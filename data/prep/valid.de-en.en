now why does that matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
ak : haa haa haaa .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : we were terrified .
here , craig is working the head .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
clay shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
there are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
and i &apos;m hopeful because it &apos;s not only philanthropy that &apos;s reorganizing itself , it &apos;s also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
we worry that im , texting , facebook are spoiling human intimacy , but stefana broadbent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships , bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonomously drifting car .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
not a challenging task .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and we all need to be invested in it .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a racetrack in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
it always takes time .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
testing in humans is around the corner .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
he wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
this is in the early 2000s . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
we &apos;ve pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
so the fiscal cliff , i was told that that &apos;s too partisan a thing to say , although i can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s supporting or attacking .
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called unproductive .
now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
none of these major theories have been completely successful .
the fear is that the world is watching .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
it &apos;s actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
i &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
in fact , this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face , of which both sides are beautiful .
now that thing , light flickers across it as you move , so it becomes a kinetic object , even though it &apos;s standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that &apos;s done on the reflection .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one .
it wins or loses at that point .
forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; thank you plato , thank you shakespeare , thank you jane austen . &quot;
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; but isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
it was quite popularly attended .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
exactly what loaning means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
flowers will arrive by the truckload .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
after they sporulate , they do rot .
when you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
all across most land masses .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
this is extremely rare fungus .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box -- you &apos;re gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
we needed to know , is life this malleable ?
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
and everybody ran up to me .
eritrea , formerly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there .
this is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the amazon .
this is actually in a riparian area .
i had to think about how i sew and how i cut , but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room .
you set the fracture , you drew the blood , you spun the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you plated the culture , you injected the antiserum .
but it &apos;s pit crews that we need , pit crews for patients .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
we looked at skyscraper construction , we looked at the aviation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
so it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those losses .
you know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
however , honeybees are a minority .
if there &apos;s a cave in new york that had 15,000 bats in it , and there are 1,000 left . that &apos;s like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years .
now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family-in-law .
and to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- i thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and i won again .
this is very promising .
why ?
the blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong , completely wrong .
so during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j.d. hooker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
so i got inspired by that .
so again , this is 2005 .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
it &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
this is ted .
and that is the spell that i want to break .
now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
they &apos;re a sort of ectosymbiont .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
that is what we have done on this planet .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
i really appreciated that .
now , i just do not believe that .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
that &apos;s the devil speaking . &quot;
so you are , in fact , a chord -- each of you an individual chord .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
i &apos;m leaving you with a little more birdsong , which is very good for you .
and he &apos;s like , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look what it has in the middle of it .
you guys are facing that way , so i &apos;ll hook it to this one .
and we actually sent this guy materials .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own passions , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
it gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
trees epitomize stasis .
that , i think , is movement .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn &apos;t recognize anymore .
that iran was once a secular society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
on that self , it should be centered -- a bigness , a wholeness .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .
you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
this animal &apos;s fossils are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .
they can just watch those videos . if they &apos;re bored , they can go ahead .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
and the khan academy videos are there .
this is shifting and reflecting functions .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios .
and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with los altos , how did that come about ?
is this ready for prime time ?
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
so on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , &quot; and who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot;
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
&quot; kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
they occasionally interest me , and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
for example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
there &apos;s something small there that responds .
it &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
one is bundled up into one sausage .
so again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
keep your eyes lifted and your head turning .
the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition .
when the subject is still very thinly populated , you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority .
i &apos;m here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done .
not created by the printing press , but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy .
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace , treats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , it &apos;s all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold , challenging circumstances .
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos , and we asked them to build with legos .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
there was a very nice correlation between love of lego and the amount of legos people built .
and i think the ceo basically did not understand the importance of meaning .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could have cheated .
people did not want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think about kids .
and i think that in the industrial revolution , adam smith was more correct than karl marx , but the reality is that we &apos;ve switched and now we &apos;re in the knowledge economy .
and this is very normal now , of modern day conflict , because they &apos;re easy to bring into wars .
and my mother &apos;s vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible , she &apos;d given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
they did not want to do this , it just happened -- they lost control .
and 70 percent regained their lives .
so i believe this kept me running .
that &apos;s the european average for new cars .
top right , bahrain has the same energy consumption per person , roughly , as canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but their population density is a factor of 300 times greater , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
if you really want to get a lot from solar panels , you need to adopt the traditional bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too .
and a third option is nuclear power .
i &apos;ve tried it . it works . some people call it a lifestyle change .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician , and , thank god , i made it .
he is a boy from a parish in caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the san agustin &apos;s junior orchestra .
that encourages them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
it &apos;s surreptitious technology that &apos;s helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time .
how do you put simple disruptive technologies , and the first of five phrases that i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk ?
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
the first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
many people in this generation won &apos;t press the button , even if they have an alert call system , because they don &apos;t want to bother anybody , even though they &apos;ve been paying 30 dollars a month .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cybercriminals &apos; latest and nastiest creations .
if you want your rivals to go offline , well , they will .
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker , called evil hacker just for comedy value , inserts something a little nasty .
there are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded .
now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
seven hundred and sixty-one of you i could identify a hotel you &apos;d been to recently , absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe .
thank you .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
and they &apos;re in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone .
now we all know that bones are fossilized , and so if you dump it into acid , there shouldn &apos;t be anything left .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
transgenesis is really cool too .
a friend of mine , a colleague of mine , dr. hans larsson at mcgill university , is actually looking at atavisms .
and people always say , &quot; why do that ?
eventually , i set about writing my book , really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale . what this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world .
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
this farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach , not one leaf of which he harvested , potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect , all going for pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
and when you use these things you don &apos;t have to go like that .
i &apos;ll go through a little of them . bolotnitsa .
left to the thymiamata .
we &apos;ve got to change this stuff up fast .
there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james coburn or richard harris .
and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other .
what a handsome cat .
before the horse .
&quot; ten milligram , 20 milligram . &quot;
once again , the cartesian kind of cross-over .
you know , try making some charts like this at home .
obviously a very small community .
now , you don &apos;t really think that our airplane system depends on the internet , and in some sense it doesn &apos;t .
now , of course you couldn &apos;t do that today .
it &apos;s not that hard a problem .
and to understand why , we must look at how , through the ages , military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace .
in a major article published in 1978 , professor robert jervis of columbia university in new york described a model to understand how conflicts could arise .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
of course , sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears , which , in my opinion , makes them much more interesting a superhero .
and he does manage to find them , but great navigation skills , lousy pick-up lines .
i couldn &apos;t fit them in .
this is what i love about comic strips , you know .
and you hear other people doing the same thing .
i followed that road in the early 1970s , soon after it was built , to take a job as the first park ranger in spatsizi wilderness .
my name is art benjamin , and i am a &quot; mathemagician . &quot;
for instance , five squared would be ?
a three-digit number , sir , yes ?
audience : nine .
yeah .
audience : 1953 .
anybody here who &apos;d like to know the day of the week they were born ?
where is he , would you stand up , 10-digit guy ?
while i explain something else -- -- i know , that you can use , right ?
i would love to talk about stuff that i &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , i suspect that what i &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
in fact , i think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and i make them out of glass .
we &apos;re studying physics , i &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; that &apos;s a good thing to do .
not just showing up every now and then .
but , probably -- one of my students , ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
let &apos;s figure out what this is .
the entranceway to the bell tower .
did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
we &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room .
i think we may have lost something in our culture .
and that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times , at virginia tech .
he taught mechanics in a high school in long beach , and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems .
i &apos;m telling you a story today about play .
and , and , and -- there are a lot more animal studies that i could talk about .
and this gives us a leg up on adaptability .
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn &apos;t eat , we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know .
so after we do that , we put it into a vacuum bag , add a little bit of seaweed , some spices , and we roll it , and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .
now , this was a month when north korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities .
the real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
by saying &quot; who is that person in the mirror ? oh it &apos;s actually me . &quot;
and it &apos;s almost impossible to perform .
and you can see here that what it &apos;s doing is it &apos;s recording my eyes every time i blink .
okay . so the last project i &apos;m going to show is this new one called snout .
but in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before , from chimpanzees , where the virus originated , into humans who hunt these apes .
we give them these little pieces of filter paper .
they &apos;re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health correspondent .
and let &apos;s face it , any new retrovirus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
and that &apos;s kind of what &apos;s happened with twitter , time after time .
this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system .
so , this would be the twitter search screen .
but that is another story .
i was startled .
now , i &apos;ve laughed every time i &apos;ve read this .
power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person , but to make it the definitive story of that person .
of course , africa is a continent full of catastrophes : there are immense ones , such as the horrific rapes in congo and depressing ones , such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in nigeria .
what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider , who has just started her own business selling hair extensions ?
we &apos;ve become addicted to their certainty , their assuredness , their definitiveness , and in the process , we have ceded our responsibility , substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom .
in every single subject , you &apos;ll be relieved to hear .
noreena hertz : how to use experts -- and when not to
you can &apos;t sit and have long talks with your old friends , because you don &apos;t know who they are .
finally , the third thing . i &apos;m trying to become a better person .
alright ? that &apos;s not something that we can finance or buy today .
and a plate comes up , holds your battery , takes it out , puts it back in , and within two minutes you &apos;re back on the road and you can go again .
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .
but one of them carlos ghosn , ceo of renault and nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating .
and pick the two best places -- the one where you didn &apos;t need any range extension .
that &apos;s another 30 percent demand on oil .
they &apos;ll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high .
and they said , &quot; well you can dig . &quot; and we decided to dig up , instead of digging down .
and what would it do to our economy ?
don &apos;t be fooled . there &apos;s nothing new about id .
this argument of course , shoots itself in the foot .
and the first paper is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence , &quot; iridium layer at the k-t boundary , potassium-argon dated crater in yucatan , indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird , way-out minority .
similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality .
&quot; &apos; agnostic , &apos; &quot; retorted aveling , &quot; was simply &apos; atheist &apos; writ respectable , and &apos; atheist &apos; was simply &apos; agnostic &apos; writ aggressive . &quot;
it lacks the strong connotation that there &apos;s definitely no god , and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics .
and so , to start helping that , i want to take us back to 1835 .
so , all of that is in the creation of content , of relevance , basic human expression .
five minutes , instead of watching tv ?
thank you very much , chris . everybody who came up here said they were scared . i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m scared , but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this .
but the truth of the matter is that this is going on .
no one can do it for you . you have to do it for yourself .
we de-linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price .
standard chartered has brought in 140 million .
and i want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women .
but what really threatens humanity ?
now , it &apos;s interesting because there are 30-odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we &apos;re still threatened by things like hiv and flu .
the antibodies you just saw in this video , in action , are the ones that make most vaccines work .
finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder .
now , it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site , and as you can imagine , these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on .
so what happened ?
this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria , e. coli .
and with these types of antibodies , we know humans can make them .
the aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
but helping africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd .
the next chapter begins with first of all , asking ourselves this fundamental question , &quot; whom do we want to help in africa ? &quot;
by creating wealth ?
these two sectors , let me describe to you , have their own indigenous institutions .
they own farms . they decide what to do , what to produce .
yes , it &apos;s an enterprise .
so when i was growing up in a really rural area in maine , the internet meant something very different to me .
but when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable .
so the best editing gives us a bit of both .
because i think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
she took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in january .
there is a carbon calculator . participant productions convened , with my active involvement , the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
so this really matters .
they don &apos;t see the little , tiny sign their kids are in the water ; they &apos;re getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals . it &apos;s a mess .
you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface , and then it is attacked , because they don &apos;t want the evidence , in my opinion .
the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year .
the biological effects are certainly hemispheric .
well , as an ornithologist , i can tell you that birds fly , and that -- and that booming a bird colony doesn &apos;t do it ; it doesn &apos;t do it .
and even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them .
we &apos;ve been here before with energy , and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery .
i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has .
i think some people agree with me .
since the 19th century , neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories -- the information that makes you , you -- maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain &apos;s neurons .
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations , and these are what are called synapses .
i assure you , this is very tiny . it &apos;s just six microns on a side .
as you grow during childhood and age during adulthood , your personal identity changes slowly .
and so the connectome is like bed of the stream ; but the metaphor is richer than that , because it &apos;s true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water , but over long timescales , the water also reshapes the bed of the stream .
the branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain .
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history .
ks : seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant , what the potential is .
when you get to the very bottom of the slide -- -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube .
we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign .
again , it &apos;s perfectly safe for people . it puts out the fires , doesn &apos;t hurt anything .
fresh watch , from inventables dairy farms .
i went to spain a few months ago and i had the best foie gras of my life .
you can also bike the tour de france without steroids , right ?
they accused him of paying off the judges .
and i thought , ok , excited jew from new york , right ?
now , what happened ?
it &apos;s the indication that it &apos;s the best foie gras .
and this squadron of geese come over .
it &apos;s brilliant , right ?
and i ended up like going down the spices , and finally , it was like , ok , salt and pepper , thinking he &apos;s salted and peppered his liver .
and i wrote , insult to history .
and the jews , fearing for their life , had to come up with an ingenious idea , or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh &apos;s wishes , of course .
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .
they &apos;ve enriched the lives of billions .
so in reinventing fire , we integrated all four sectors that use energy -- transportation , buildings , industry and electricity -- and we integrated four kinds of innovation , not just technology and policy , but also design and business strategy .
audi claimed it &apos;s going to beat them both by a year .
saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred , adds up to a $ 4 trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero .
the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings .
china leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost .
portugal was 45 percent renewable powered , denmark 36 .
and the results may at first seem incredible , but as marshall mcluhan said , &quot; only puny secrets need protection .
my father was responsible for building roads in bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
recently , the world bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
these are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
so , so , because i have nothing to show , nothing to say , we shall try to speak about something else .
because there is not a human production which exists outside of what i call &quot; the big image . &quot;
we have a way to look at earth like that , you know , &quot; i am the man . the final man .
nobody &apos;s obliged to be a genius .
that means , we can imagine -- i don &apos;t say it was fantastic , but in the &apos; 80s , there was not too much war , like that , it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized .
we have just to finish the story .
they still have old blackboards and whatnot .
i don &apos;t think so .
i spend a lot of time with youth groups , and i say to people , &quot; when does the education process begin ? &quot;
the education process begins even before the child is born , and if you don &apos;t do that , you &apos;re going to have difficulty .
and so they said , &quot; look , let &apos;s take his rotc grades and roll them into his overall gpa and see what happens . &quot;
they kept us in play .
and i would order the hot dog from the guy , and he &apos;d start to fix it , and then he &apos;d look around at the bodyguards and the police cars -- &quot; i &apos;ve got a green card ! i &apos;ve got a green card ! &quot;
i &apos;m a marketer , and as a marketer , i know that i &apos;ve never really been in control .
companies can give people more control , but they can also give them less control .
because everyone was a hero .
platforms like youtube , twitter , facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that , &quot; wow , i &apos;m not alone .
and everyone started to think that &quot; this guy could be my brother . &quot;
in fact , the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas , help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing .
people were so empowered .
wael ghonim : inside the egyptian revolution
well , babies all over the world are what i like to describe as &quot; citizens of the world . &quot;
it &apos;s raising lots of questions about bilingual people .
the social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics .
what i am trying to do as a photographer , as an artist , is to bring the world of art and science together .
it &apos;s got an oily consistency .
maybe you have experienced some of those properties before , but i am talking about the physical properties , not the other ones .
i want to address the issue of compassion .
and we run clinics in these very remote regions where there &apos;s no medical care whatsoever .
now i worked with dying people for over 40 years .
you know , if compassion is so good for us , i have a question .
he sees something in the path .
the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number , or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well .
now , as much fun as it is to discover these patterns , it &apos;s even more satisfying to understand why they are true .
math is logical , functional and just ... awesome . mathemagician arthur benjamin explores hidden properties of that weird and wonderful set of numbers , the fibonacci series .
and he started asking me questions .
like a couple months ago in times square in new york , there was this pakistani muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .
they &apos;re obsessed with having the biggest , tallest , longest , as we all know .
and i &apos;ve been guilty of stereotyping as well .
one of my favorite magicians is karl germain .
let &apos;s play a game .
and when you give yourself over to that deception , it becomes magic .
now , i found the answer very quickly .
and as we were eating , i had the distinct feeling that i was back in the city of london , having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist .
and the ira , which control the private transportation system in northern ireland , did exactly the same thing .
the entry point , of course , of most of this money were the off-shore facilities .
now , you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking .
cumulatively , i will have rowed over 8,000 miles , taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat .
and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking , &quot; oh boy , i &apos;m on totally the wrong track here .
it was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one .
and finally : am i crazy ?
so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again .
so there are very real implications for human health .
the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions .
i really believe that we stand at a very important point in history .
and yet , now , it &apos;s talked about all the time .
i mean , it goes on in our private lives , too , every single day .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper .
it has its own built-in swimming pool , very , very cool .
it &apos;s all about sensuality . it &apos;s all about touch .
take it from me . under the bed is not a good hiding spot .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence .
so we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &apos;d be lonely forever , that we &apos;d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed .
you built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself .
the background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis .
it goes like this .
in the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis of all of these values that we &apos;ve been talking about , and i think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be canadians .
it impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness , where there is 90 percent reduction of key species , like woodland caribou and grizzly bears , and it consumes even more energy , more water , and produces at least as much greenhouse gas .
and not that many years ago , i was lent a boat by a first nations man .
and the great bear rainforest is generally considered to be the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world .
right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .
he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect , whether on the roof of a temple in singapore , or in his increasingly ambitious installation work , here with 192 functioning sewing machines , fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations .
ravin agrawal : 10 young indian artists to watch
clearly a complex problem , but is it complicated ?
your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes .
a recent study from &#91; university of michigan &#93; showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools .
it happens to one in three , and it happened to me .
they talked about feeling stronger and braver .
how do you get from trauma to growth ?
nice . wow . that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever seen that .
keep it up . i love it !
thank you .
and i went and put a little announcement up on our site , asking for people to join us in this enterprise .
and more and more people get involved in this , most of whom we &apos;ve never met .
mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
it &apos;s a bit suspicious isn &apos;t it ? there is two answers to the question so far , zero and one .
i &apos;ve stitched euclid &apos;s parallel postulate on to the surface .
and all of our contributors , who are an amazing collection of people around the world , do their own embellishments .
well , as chris pointed out , i study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
ok . now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
there are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
and , believe it or not , if i show you a picture of your mother -- i &apos;m talking about normal people -- you start sweating .
one of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
and then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , ok ?
now , i said , &quot; move your normal hand and phantom . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , no , no , you know this phantom i &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
he pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
so we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
here &apos;s what i call martian alphabet . just like your alphabet , a is a , b is b , c is c .
and i &apos;m happy most of the time , because i think this is the happiest species on the planet .
but there are a lot of similarities .
one discovery was that wild bonobos often walk bidpedally .
these are happy vocalizations .
realizing that nyota might get hurt , panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
so we want to create an environment in which bonobos , like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun , and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them .
we &apos;re learning how to become like them .
if we go beyond our solar system , we &apos;ve learned that the stars aren &apos;t twinkly points of light .
stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together .
the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms , within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be .
when einstein died in 1955 , one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by herblock in the washington post .
or will the biosphere stabilize ?
and fantasizing about what they &apos;d do .
we let them go about their day . they did whatever they wanted to do .
so we went , in fact , to uganda and ran a very similar experiment .
compare that to this woman from uganda .
just below that to the right is rwanda though , which is amazingly green .
and we did the exact same thing as before .
it &apos;s actually from yitzhak rabin .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evaporated .
but some want war .
that &apos;s the power of taking one piece of data , another piece of data , putting it together , and showing the result .
every flash is an edit . somebody somewhere looking at the open street map , and realizing it could be better .
now , lesters in lesterland have this extraordinary power .
and number two , obviously , this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle , understated , camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy .
so the right wants smaller government .
climate change is mine , but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality .
when connecticut adopted this system , in the very first year , 78 percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only .
a government dependent upon the people alone .
and the reactions to sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
one day they &apos;ll get here .
everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves .
birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart .
a computer is , in a way , just another experiment .
well , you don &apos;t have to be a whole creature .
we can try this first . if i just put them on the table together , there &apos;s no reason for them to synchronize , and they probably won &apos;t .
these cables were on the side of the bridge , like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the thames -- that &apos;s what &apos;s holding up this bridge .
no , they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge .
interviewer : you designed this , yes , this simulated bridge , and this , you reckon , mimics the action of the real bridge ?
and he described the diversity within crops -- all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such -- as a genetic resource .
in the united states , in the 1800s -- that &apos;s where we have the best data -- farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples .
and i guess there &apos;s a lesson to be learned here , and the lesson is : so why save it ?
the agricultural system and , more importantly , the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before .
it &apos;s a remarkably beautiful landscape . i can &apos;t even begin to describe it to you .
this is a backup system for world agriculture .
and we need to support it financially .
global warming fun .
4 am in the morning .
now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today , but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes .
the most impressive spaceship ever , i believe , was a grumman lunar lander . it was a -- you know , it landed on the moon , take off of the moon , didn &apos;t need any maintenance guys -- that &apos;s kind of cool .
the first industry will be a high volume , a lot of players .
the military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the sr71 . it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly , and was taken out of service . the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
i think what we &apos;ll do is we &apos;ll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we &apos;re first or not really doesn &apos;t matter .
but then i noticed all their friends were like them , so that was a bad theory .
and he says , &quot; well i used to be a banker and now i &apos;m a gold miner . &quot;
this is different . here , we &apos;re talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations : employees , customers , business partners , shareholders , and so on .
do you know about this ?
you can see this playing out today in egypt .
the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
well , if we could do this , we could attack some big problems in the world .
in total , there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide , that all look on the surface to be different from one another , but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator .
we call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it &apos;s completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .
and here he is six years later , guinness , with his very happy owner .
and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating .
so imagine if we could create the world &apos;s first rating system in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic , cancer-preventative properties .
so this approach that we &apos;re taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity .
william li presents a new way to think about treating cancer and other diseases : anti-angiogenesis , preventing the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor . the crucial first step : eating cancer-fighting foods that cut off the supply lines and beat cancer at its own game .
i read martin gardner &apos;s columns in scientific american .
this is called a figure-ground illusion .
and so i think a lot about interaction .
now , this one is a little bit trickier .
there is only one solution . it &apos;s not that hard .
there is also a trend towards games that are good for you .
oh , yeah . there , okay . j-o and -- i guess that &apos;s that part . we got the bow . that bow helps .
to be a man means not to be a girl .
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened .
i &apos;ve seen girls starving themselves to death in america in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves .
and she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank .
and in the years that agnes has had the house , she has changed the situation there .
we will not cut you .
i know when a storm is coming .
i am an emotional creature .
that was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to , to bind mr. carrillo over to stand trial for a first-degree murder .
but also because i have expertise and testify about the nature of human night vision .
now , he didn &apos;t use a real gun in his hand , so he had a black object in his hand that was similar to the gun that was described .
he is now a freed man .
and if he does this an infinite number of times , which you can do in mathematics , he ends up with an infinite number of lines , each of which has an infinite number of points in it .
so here &apos;s the second iteration , and the third , fourth and so on .
so , when i got to the village , i said , &quot; can you take me to the square building ?
no , because a widely shared design practice doesn &apos;t necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not &quot; in the dna . &quot;
and of course fences around the world are all cartesian , all strictly linear .
but i had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed , buried in sand , and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on .
the national science foundation &apos;s broadening participation in computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools , so hopefully in three years , anybody &apos;ll be able to go on the web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts .
the last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family .
one has lacrosse on the near side of town .
in sutherland &apos;s system , companies don &apos;t use large , massive projects that take two years .
so following the agile model , we ask three questions : what worked well in our family this week , what didn &apos;t work well , and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead ?
i &apos;ve taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met .
so time-shift family dinner . that &apos;s adaptability .
every minute above that , we have to do one pushup .
i made popcorn . actually , i burned one , so i made two .
as the author of the study told me , children who have a sense of -- they &apos;re part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence .
in the end , this may be the greatest lesson of all .
so what &apos;s going on here ? what &apos;s happening ?
the explorers slaughtered the braves . sweeney : horribly .
on a dark and stormy night -- really ! -- it was the 10th of july , 1856 .
it is the magic of science .
we are still asking the question .
so this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial .
there are eight children in the family .
this is work done with my colleague helen mayberg from emory .
and indeed , we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glucose to use glucose once again .
and the constraints in building any organism , when you look at it , are really severe . natural technologies have incredible constraints .
and many organisms fit this kind of pattern .
this is an eight-legged scorpion , six-legged ant , forty-four-legged centipede .
another reason why animals have extraordinary performance , and can go anywhere , is because they have an effective interaction with the environment . the animal i &apos;m going to show you , that we studied to look at this , is the gecko .
it can do this in 14 milliseconds . it &apos;s unbelievable .
how about wet adhesion ? or capillary adhesion ?
the numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction .
what are the messages we tell our daughters ?
my brother is kind of busy .
but it &apos;s not that simple .
i learned that i need to keep my hand up . &quot;
and she starts thinking about having a child , and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child , she starts thinking about making room for that child .
i think it would be a better world .
not a lot of cool , sexy stuff happening in dentistry .
so they asked them at the beginning , &quot; do you think you &apos;ll actually be able to stick with this program ? &quot;
so you start with personalized data , personalized information that comes from an individual , and then you need to connect it to their lives .
but by and large , this is a feedback loop that &apos;s so nifty and too rare .
it isn &apos;t this kind of vague promise that it &apos;s going to work no matter what , but you get the statistics for how effective it is .
then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context , and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls .
now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know , a psa test is a very controversial test .
and then , what &apos;s next ?
and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesn &apos;t take all your concentration , you really can &apos;t get hurt -- it &apos;s not like woodworking -- and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation .
so i started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called &quot; the botany of desire . &quot;
their complexity , their sophistication , is something to really marvel at , and i think it &apos;s really the scandal of the human genome project .
all the six different species -- rabbits , actually -- are all performing ecological services for one another , such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another .
well , look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
yeah , boston .
they &apos;ve created this thing called the open graph , and they own all of our connections .
and these dynamics are a little scary sometimes , because you think , you know , other people can be using forces that will manipulate how i interact : what i do , where i do it , when i do it .
this is one that isn &apos;t a game yet , but really should be .
but let &apos;s use it consciously . like why have games that you can lose ?
these progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world .
it is very powerful . it is very exciting .
there &apos;s a lot of activity in china .
now , each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own .
sb : yes ! somebody got it .
larry page : thank you , sergey .
and so that &apos;s basically what we &apos;ve done since we instituted that a few years ago , and i think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized .
we had this on our website for a while , but we found that after we put it on our website , we didn &apos;t get any job applications anymore .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
the other thing i wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information , and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine -- that we should provide very objective information .
both great designs and actually very innovative too .
and as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems , there are some basic ideas that i think we can observe that are useful .
they make their own intraocular lenses .
but i &apos;d like to go back to brunel here , and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now , and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool .
and then ideo and acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns , community outreach strategies , business models , new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water .
but i really like my tea sweet . &quot;
in america , the primary locus of choice is the individual .
or , you could say that the individual &apos;s preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .
you know , research shows repeatedly that we can &apos;t actually tell the difference between coke and pepsi .
choice no longer offers opportunities , but imposes constraints .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the united states , the final decision rested with the parents .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn &apos;t always work out that way .
and so one time i was in a beauty salon , and i was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink .
sheena iyengar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make . at tedglobal , she talks about both trivial choices and profound ones , and shares her groundbreaking research that has uncovered some surprising attitudes about our decisions .
normally it &apos;s at the back .
so we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy , but the idea is , what is the purpose of technology if it doesn &apos;t reach the right hands ?
it will be just a way to , say , greenwash your audience and , say , increase your price tag .
girl 2 : and then you can download onto your ipod .
now , i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities , or the media community , is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently .
journalist : what about that , admiral ?
if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know , say , century city , it would fit beautifully .
and of course , as the computer industry develops interactively , producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea .
they were great tv because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
there was the vietnam war . there was black liberation .
the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks .
voice 1 : say , mom , windows for radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family .
and i think it &apos;s the reason that tv &apos;s so challenged .
voice 2 : you mean we &apos;ll have to live here , together ?
they think of the old medium , because the old medium is always the content of the new medium , as movies tend to be the content of tv , and as books used to be the content , novels used to be the content of movies .
but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized , you know , the first job of design is to serve a social purpose .
it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions .
the extreme might be in italy where , again , there &apos;s kind of some type of control over what &apos;s happening in the environment is very evident , even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals .
and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional .
and of course , in a way , when i say romance , i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation .
i &apos;d wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class .
so i started doing that .
there are some very light people , some extremely heavy people , maybe people with a lot of bulk up top .
and they go up easily .
so that &apos;s where a headrest comes in .
and that &apos;s not really the case .
now this is a mosquito that came , like its name suggests , out of north africa , and it &apos;s spread round the world .
having said that , actually , your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt and a little bit of deet to go with it .
it &apos;s just the female .
and we &apos;ve got a production unit in oxford , or just south of oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos .
my train was a heart attack .
and if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
the one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : they never ask me about my place history .
we can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
now follow me , ok ?
nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water , or swim in a blue algae-infested lake .
and more importantly still , phosphorus is a key component of dna , something everyone is familiar with , and which is shown in this image .
nobody wants to throw their money out the window , but unfortunately that &apos;s what is happening here .
by 2050 there will be 9 billion of us , and according to the u.n. food and agriculture organization , we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today .
it will proliferate between the root &apos;s cells , eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure , which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom .
mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years , and it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify .
interestingly , in the last 10 years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery , with the structural engineer chris williams .
so , a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields : whether it &apos;s automobiles , architecture , products , etc . , it &apos;s really being affected by this digital medium of curvature .
they saw this actually solving a problem : this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic .
we were one of the finalists for the world trade center site design .
this is part of the amazon basin , a place called rondônia in the south-center part of the brazilian amazon .
this is a photograph flying into arizona , and when you look at it , you &apos;re like , &quot; what are they growing here ? &quot; it turns out they &apos;re growing lettuce in the middle of the desert using water sprayed on top .
this is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is , this is a change in the fundamentals of the environment of this region .
it &apos;s more than all our electricity .
this is work that we &apos;re doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment .
global croplands cover 16 million km ² .
so where do we go from here ?
andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump , earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler , which meant he carried a scale and went around and weighed all the materials that people had scavenged from the dump . now he &apos;s a scrap dealer .
uac foods has recognized that it won &apos;t sell if it &apos;s in stores .
you can buy cuecas baratas , designer underwear that isn &apos;t really manufactured by a designer , and even pirated evangelical mixtapes .
there &apos;s also a huge emotional impact .
you open it , these muscles contract .
so you might say , let &apos;s go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals , or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there .
and that gave us the opportunity to do targeted reinnervation .
he feels hot , cold , sharp , dull , all in his missing hand , or both his hand and his chest , but he can attend to either .
ak : a little slow , and it was just hard to work .
can we get more out of it ?
so now it &apos;s able to train with just this little piece on the back .
tk : that &apos;s claudia , and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .
we took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm .
on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries .
however , the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries .
but first , i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system , for the oceans and for the earth .
you have to train to be able to do that .
i fell in love with penguins , and it certainly has changed the rest of my life .
but the population is declining and it &apos;s declined fairly substantially , about 21 percent since 1987 , when i started these surveys , in terms of number of active nests .
eventually , the government listened and , amazingly , they changed their laws .
if you had a relationship with a penguin , you &apos;d see it in the same sort of way .
okay , so here are a few penguins coming in .
in tedistan , there are no borders , just connected spaces and unconnected spaces .
the entire planet is covered by sovereign , independent nation-states .
well , just on the other side of the amo river , in the heilongjiang and harbin provinces of china , you have over 100 million people .
trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region , so much of it being invested into china .
so no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders , what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures , but in a much more fluid , imperial zone .
now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region .
well , there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we &apos;re talking about it now .
the e.u. also became a currency block , and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world .
pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism .
then we &apos;ll wind up with the world we want , a borderless one .
and now i want to show what they actually look like in this movie here .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
you know about a lot of them .
as you age , you &apos;re much more likely to get cancer , alzheimer &apos;s disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases .
so what about the normal worm ?
we all have foxo genes , but we don &apos;t all have exactly the same form of the foxo gene .
thank you .
and nobody knows if they really can live forever , or what keeps them from aging .
it &apos;s a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what &apos;s happening .
here &apos;s another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .
as you may have noticed , our elections in canada are a complete joke .
think about it : in 2013 , the second decade of the millennium , if you &apos;re concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor , you get bone scans , biopsies and blood tests .
so in this way , by doing this kind of test , we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors , something that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to do right now in humans .
and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long-lasting , and also appears to be graded .
in adhd , it &apos;s often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability .
but that &apos;s fascinating , right ?
and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment .
since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected , she &apos;s convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite .
and better still , imagine what would happen if , in a very large area , everyone would take these drugs , this drug , for just three weeks .
and in some areas , the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living , unrelated donors .
today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells .
indeed , we live in both challenging as well as exciting times .
he &apos;s the greatest young conductor in the world .
they &apos;ll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll .
for example , the happy wife .
and it &apos;s not just successfully starring in films that &apos;s dangerous .
and we do like a cocktail or two .
so you &apos;re looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach .
it &apos;s hard to do in animals that run around , and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously .
this is the first ever such experiment , sort of the optical equivalent of galvani &apos;s .
each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly .
if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right , you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet , it marches straight through , as it did before .
so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again , the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .
and it &apos;s dependent on passive patients who just take it and don &apos;t ask any questions .
thomas batuik : hi there , eric .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. batiuk .
i did not have a heart problem . i had an overdose problem .
and i think that &apos;s why i achieved longevity .
now , in terms of biomimetics , as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature , nature becomes a much more useful teacher .
robert full : that &apos;s what she did on rough surfaces .
well we know that tails store fat , for example .
if you make it slip a huge amount , this is what we discovered .
and show the video .
watch the animal .
and from what i heard from our new president , i &apos;m very optimistic . thank you .
now , you &apos;ve heard about &quot; two degrees &quot; : that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees .
is co2 produced by man &apos;s activities causing the planet to warm up ?
that &apos;s the ross sea ice shelf on the right there .
and we saw about 35 alternations between open water and ice-covered water , between gravels and these plant sediments .
so one of the things thought of in the &apos; 80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event .
now the reason we know it &apos;s 1584 is that these corals have growth bands .
but they all tell us what the natural variability is .
and on coral reefs , where some of the main framework organisms disappear , we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .
and in that moment , there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved .
that &apos;s one theory that might be able to describe all of nature &apos;s forces from one set of ideas , one set of principles , one master equation , if you will .
it &apos;s in manhattan . you &apos;re in central park -- it &apos;s kind of irrelevant -- but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint , but you and i all know that it does have some thickness .
even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks .
one of the other predictions of string theory -- no , that &apos;s not one of the other predictions of string theory .
so just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument , strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving .
einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can warp and curve -- that &apos;s what gravity is .
and yet , even at this most fundamental level , context is everything .
the one on the right comes from a yellow surface , in shadow , oriented facing the left , viewed through a pinkish medium .
so let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality , even at the simplest thing the brain does , which is color .
and the same thing over on the right .
now i want you to keep looking at it .
and now , in this experiment they get rewarded if they go to the blue flowers .
on the left is what his camera sees .
and what we have here -- can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left , and 25 , call it yellowish , surfaces on your right ?
every time you get some security , you &apos;re always trading off something .
the answer is , we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality .
you don &apos;t hear about lion attacks , there aren &apos;t a lot of lions around .
so back to economics .
it doesn &apos;t change ; it &apos;s real .
models can come from the media , from our elected officials .
when swine flu first appeared , the initial news caused a lot of overreaction .
nowadays , no kid will let you drive if you &apos;re not wearing a seat belt .
so in the technological world , we don &apos;t have experience to judge models .
we don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s not just reality ; it &apos;s feeling and reality .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study .
she should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register .
they built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
that was enough . it really got the city behind it .
and honestly , even though i love the designs that we were building , i was always frightened that i wouldn &apos;t really love it , because i fell in love with that wildscape -- and how could you recreate that magic ?
they need political solutions .
we just have to persevere . &quot;
this is tahrir square .
talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
sometimes you have to .
we need to improve the necessary skills , and we need the courage to use them .
it &apos;s a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that i do .
everyone wants to know , how did they make them , how did they transport them ?
the red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors . it &apos;s called the open fuel cycle .
now , i &apos;m also very interested in cooking .
she is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever .
you hike around , you see something like this .
now , i &apos;m also really big on photography .
but ultimately , i decided that what i really ought to do is not fight being who i am , but embrace it .
and there probably are special cases of that .
but it rarely happens in biology .
and so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way .
so if i zoom into that picture , i can just show you what it means .
we &apos;re treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill .
&quot; well , it &apos;s in the kitchen . &quot; &quot; oh , you must have kitchen water . &quot;
and so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer , and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job .
and it &apos;s within these tribes that all of our work gets done .
stage one produces people who do horrible things .
but here is the point . if you believe and you say to people in your tribe , in effect , &quot; my life sucks .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
there is , in fact , another stage .
we &apos;re great ! who is not great ? england ! &quot;
one of the people we interviewed was frank jordan , former mayor of san francisco . before that he was chief of police in san francisco .
if gallup releases a poll on the same day that nbc releases a poll , people will pay attention to the gallup poll . okay , we understand that .
another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch .
or the recorded crowing of a rooster ?
the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap .
unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century turkish figs for breakfast .
compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others , both in our private and in our civic spaces .
and i don &apos;t imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him , but he &apos;s paraplegic .
our traditions have always known this , and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us .
this is the full photograph , and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket , smoking a cigar .
when i was nine years old i went off to summer camp for the first time .
but for years i denied this intuition , and so i became a wall street lawyer , of all things , instead of the writer that i had always longed to be -- partly because i needed to prove to myself that i could be bold and assertive too .
and kids are working in countless group assignments .
and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly santa claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona .
but then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality .
but he also loved his congregation , and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi .
and i want to be clear about what i &apos;m saying , because i deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas .
so , what i &apos;d like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself , because i &apos;d like to put in context what i &apos;m going to tell you .
now , technology has changed a lot since the victrola days .
now , one of the things i &apos;d like to explain &#91; about &#93; 50x15 , which i think is really critical , is that it is not a charity .
i don &apos;t think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world , and just dumping product and selling into the markets .
and one of the things that i learned , too , from my parents -- and i &apos;ll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father .
just existing .
um .
that if you are a leader in any area -- in business , in politics , in sports , in art , in academics , in any area -- you don &apos;t own it ; you are a steward of it .
it determines , really , everything in your life .
now , that &apos;s a principle in the bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity , give it away to help other people .
because i start getting all kinds of invitations .
i pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of america -- a bunch of gated communities .
you know , if god &apos;s going to show up , he &apos;s not going to show up on cheese bread .
what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
and if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life , you need to look at your shape . what am i wired to do ?
there are one billion children in the world , and 50 percent of them don &apos;t have electricity at home or at school .
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
we can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
thank you guys .
juan enriquez challenges our definition of bioenergy . oil , coal , gas and other hydrocarbons are not chemical but biological products , based on plant matter -- and thus , growable . our whole approach to fuel , he argues , needs to change .
we were the largest operator of hotels in the bay area , so we were particularly vulnerable .
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers , i realized we had no metrics .
the king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later .
how many know him ? anybody ?
certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
and only 36 percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture .
chip conley : measuring what makes life worthwhile
but actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
and who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
bl : &quot; can you help me , henry ? &quot; what good scientist says that , right ?
typical science , actually , right ? so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
you have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . all right ?
it shortens the lives of the people who live there in the gulf .
now you think to yourself -- because i know how you are -- you say , &quot; that sure is terrible for those poor people .
well that insight of biomimicry , of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species .
and really , they fundamentally told you , &quot; are you going to hug a tree , or are you going to hug a child ? pick .
it &apos;s expensive -- so expensive that very few people could own or use it .
i mean to be able to take off from your home , you &apos;d have to be extremely quiet .
fortunately , dr. felix wankel invented the rotary engine .
there &apos;s an interesting poll that came out recently under nas -- i think it &apos;s msnbc -- in which they asked the question , &quot; are you in the market for a volantor ? &quot;
wires suck , they really do .
it &apos;s a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a macarthur fellowship award , which is nicknamed the genius award , last september , for his discovery .
these electric cars are beautiful .
how many people want to hang them on the wall ?
you &apos;ll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back , to do that , and it probably beeps , actually , as it goes on as well .
the short answer is : they return to the environment in one way or another , continuing the cycle of toxicity .
but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body , i imagine the infinity mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment .
so i &apos;d like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in china , the night i met my husband .
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely .
this time it &apos;s on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that i &apos;ve never met before tells me that terence is dying , perhaps tonight .
yet i had that piece of paper .
you &apos;ve succeeded in everything you &apos;ve done , and having a patient die , well , that must feel like failure .
this is a poem about mark antony .
it &apos;s going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world .
i bet many of you have seen the apple commercials , kind of poking at the pc for their brilliance and simplicity .
an ortho-view , a nadir-view . how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model ?
one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai .
country 1 has more telephones , and country 1 has a longer system of railways .
let me look at this question more directly .
taiwan succeeded , china under mao zedong didn &apos;t .
china held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis-a-vis india .
what about the political system ?
but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth .
because , before the spread of coffee and tea through british culture , what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank -- day-in and day-out , from dawn until dusk was alcohol .
it &apos;s a new configuration that has never formed before .
and that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like , right .
they have a feeling that there &apos;s an interesting problem , but they don &apos;t quite have the tools yet to discover them .
and it &apos;s monday morning , and the news has just broken about this satellite that &apos;s now orbiting the planet .
and they said , &quot; jeez , you know , we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it &apos;s farthest away .
chance favors the connected mind .
think about what happened , after all , to the poor frog .
we can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before .
and why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage ?
what worries me more is a different nightmare scenario .
so we have had tremendous success , and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit , and we started using expressions like &quot; lifesaving . &quot;
and i thought , surely , we do better than that .
anyway , we had a major cultural issue .
yeah , yeah . sure . &quot;
and she was going along the tracks , and the tracks split .
and so i thought , &quot; maybe if it can promote cell growth , it can inhibit cell death , too . &quot;
it &apos;s almost as if we &apos;re getting back to this starting point .
some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle , there &apos;s a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle .
and what myod essentially does is , it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells . so this compound , myod , has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells .
and of course , i was immediately intrigued .
this is on the way to school .
&quot; sorry , i have to go on an assignment , i &apos;ll be back &quot; -- and then you never come back .
no one in the village would tell me where hyun-sook was , because the grandmother had always hidden her from westerners .
i said , &quot; but you know , i bought an airline ticket , and i &apos;m stuck here for a week . &quot;
and the pictures before were taken in september .
so , it was a really big deal when the letters showed up .
we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
this has got to be a nightmare , this can &apos;t be happening .
it &apos;s so weird how life just goes on .
so , at this point , natasha doesn &apos;t speak a word of english , other than what little father keene taught her .
kodak hired natasha to be a translator for them at the olympics in korea .
now that was , ironically , and very befittingly , the way we found his grave .
but we learn a lot from that : not only that there is a planet there , but we also learn its size .
but you see , we haven &apos;t gone very far .
we know and expect that we &apos;ll see that .
from the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that i just showed you , where we actually tried that , and it feeds back and forth , and we hope to meet in the middle one day .
and let &apos;s compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms .
there is immense , powerful potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the earth are common .
so , ready , steady , go !
but it &apos;s very good that what is done is being done .
but that &apos;s very simplistic , so let &apos;s go down and look at tanzania .
india has many because they are many .
you can get this chart , free .
they start off pretty close together .
it &apos;s not geography .
but you know , this is a ted audience , and if i keep talking about institutions , you &apos;re going to turn off .
that really was a killer application .
you &apos;ve all bought an article of clothing in the last month ; i guarantee it .
it &apos;s open source .
that &apos;s so true .
and that &apos;s all we seem to be caring about recently .
to put that into perspective , this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees , a mere seven million years ago .
there &apos;s the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web .
so what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors .
think of hunting with silly string .
it can be for profit or not profit . it can be large or small .
to draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals .
you just said , &quot; i &apos;ll call you when i get there . &quot;
but that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long , flat tail .
right ? so the question is , do you want that photo ? yes or no .
the psycho milt question is , was it a good idea ?
this is happening , however , against the background of the rise of web logging .
a support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group .
it &apos;s two resins that are , sort of , in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue , but when you put the two together , something happens . a bond takes place , and you get this very strong , powerful adhesive .
the other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment .
that &apos;s called &quot; rounding . &quot;
and stage 11 , we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away .
but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
it &apos;s so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life .
what i &apos;d like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano .
okay ?
i took the idea of the wristwatch , and i turned it into a musical score .
so with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
one thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
so there are two really remarkable things about this .
there &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
if this is true , if these babies are designed to learn -- and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for -- we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
if i showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
alison gopnik : okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
that &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning .
to produce these animations , an animator at a studio has to anticipate what &apos;s going to happen in the actual game , and then has to animate that particular sequence .
so , we simulated that as well , and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .
what you see here is the character standing there , and there &apos;s an obstacle that we put in its way .
it &apos;s going to stick out its hands .
and this is what happens .
so if you look at the character carefully , you see there are lots of body movements going on , none of which you have to animate like in the old days .
we did that . it took about altogether just two hours , pretty much , to create the simulation .
we can only do several behaviors right now .
torsten reil talks about how the study of biology can help make natural-looking animated people -- by building a human from the inside out , with bones , muscles and a nervous system . he spoke at in 2003 ; see his work now in gta4 .
i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns , fathers , brothers , sisters .
you have to separate fact from bias , right .
and you listen to the sounds of silence .
i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day .
and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades .
thank you -- yes , i designed the dialog box . no , no , no .
it &apos;s like a 747 shuttle cockpit .
even windows is a hack . we &apos;re kind of based loosely on the mac .
i know the ropes now , know what the tricks are .
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software , and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .
hear , hear !
and we really don &apos;t have experience with pandemics , and we &apos;re also not very good as a society at acting to things we don &apos;t have direct and sort of gut-level experience with .
i &apos;ve been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk .
but these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there &apos;s a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market .
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .
if we let an unlimited amount of power loose , then we will -- a very small number of people will be able to abuse it .
it &apos;s especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember , you know , galileo essentially locked up , and who are still fighting this battle against the church .
the next element is the fact that i have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life .
well , if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what i thought the chances of life on mars would be , i would &apos;ve probably said , a couple of percent .
it also may be very , very different in its fundamental properties – its chemistry , or its size .
it &apos;s bursting with life .
and you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys -- these are gardens of these bacteria .
these are hopping microbot swarms .
take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal , okay ?
well , you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .
the prayer book was discovered by this guy , johan ludvig heiberg , in 1906 .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
and the image on the left is the normal red image .
because the ink was written in iron .
and the important point about this is that it &apos;s the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics .
now all this data that we collected , all the images , all the raw images , all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a creative commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose .
now , there is no need for these restrictions at all .
with the generous backing of a magazine i write for sometimes , i decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine .
and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served , and so i &apos;m afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .
and he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light .
and to try this -- i couldn &apos;t get a loaner , but i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which i used .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to rattle .
it was three days , four meals .
now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media .
and this kind of a world , this vast flying beast you can ride around , shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking .
the game &apos;s just trying to get people to open about a million boxes , getting better and better stuff in them .
so all this is very powerful .
you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
this can all seem very sinister .
we can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks .
skeletons are ubiquitous ; they &apos;re found all over the place .
so what started out as an idea , is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens .
so we said screw it , we &apos;ll just start our own company , which we did three years ago .
and as you can see , that &apos;s three-quarters of the food that we &apos;re eating for the most part : processed foods and fast foods .
i think that &apos;s the only way to look at it .
and you know , these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in africa who are small farmers and people in america who are farmers and eaters .
now , something else happened .
and we don &apos;t understand why they won &apos;t let us in . right ?
that meant that they were able to perform , as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium , thrust , flat floor , arena , traverse , you name it .
and effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine .
in order to do that , again , we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks .
but most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure , is something that is represented by this .
and last but not least the entire at &amp; amp ; t performing arts center .
and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody &apos;s life .
so the next movement is called mobs .
the first such one is called &quot; the whale hunt . &quot;
i built a web interface for viewing &quot; the whale hunt &quot; that attempts to do just this .
and now we &apos;ve whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs , and then we can enter the narrative at that position .
so i &apos;m going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did , some of the people i spoke with .
there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic , with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road , and he was driving one of these trucks .
finally , this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .
jh : so if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .
the other guy was still working on me , collapsing my other lung , and i managed to , by hitting that guy , to get a minute .
we always hear that texting is a scourge .
for two hours before that , edward everett spoke on a topic that , frankly , cannot engage us today and barely did then .
this is an actual text that was done by a non-male person of about 20 years old not too long ago .
slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today .
as it happens , he was writing about what had become french .
and this just came off last september at ars electronica ; we repeated it in england .
why are we still stuck in afghanistan ?
there was amazing improvements .
now is this a new idea ?
you feel deep , deep guilt .
a million properties have been returned .
and the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain , in every temperature , at every period -- a guide who , above all , knows when to turn back , who doesn &apos;t press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
so , in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of , in this case , urine .
and the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left .
i &apos;ll show you in a moment , that &apos;s actually quite useful .
but even that &apos;s complicated , because to you , to me , colors might indicate &quot; normal , &quot; but , after all , we &apos;re all suffering from probably an excess of education .
it distributes itself , flows through further holes , distributes itself .
here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer .
that was john kerry &apos;s home state .
if those people had voted for obama , even half of them , obama would have won louisiana safely .
this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year .
racism is predictable . and it &apos;s predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you , people of other races .
her blood pressure was an alarming 230 over 170 .
she says , &quot; it was good . &quot;
he began to tap on the chests of his patients , on their abdomens .
i &apos;ve gotten into some trouble in silicon valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who &apos;s in the computer .
it had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there .
and when my ritual began , this very voluble patient began to quiet down .
i &apos;m an infectious disease physician , and in the early days of hiv , before we had our medications , i presided over so many scenes like this .
i will be with you through the end . &quot;
it &apos;ll go this way for sure .
it &apos;s a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
so , although it &apos;s possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles .
faces are important for us socially .
so we walked around the backside , just to see what was going on here , where -- it turns out wherever there &apos;s a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect .
very -- one of the top popular singers in england today , katie melua .
heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combined , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable for almost everybody .
i &apos;ve seen this firsthand over and over again .
we tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists .
and i want to share a couple stories with you today .
and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented .
that you are in charge , and you &apos;re going to tell people what to do next .
and it turns out that it &apos;s tribes -- not money , not factories -- that can change our world , that can change politics , that can align large numbers of people .
now there is a million things i could share with you about the mechanics here .
what it requires , as geraldine carter has discovered , is to be able to say , &quot; i can &apos;t do this by myself .
and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
but also the key is that it &apos;s found in the earliest stages of the disease , when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival .
so i went in that direction .
yes . that &apos;s right . this is barbie .
but it &apos;s not about fire and brimstone either .
shereen el feki : pop culture in the arab world
give me comfort , give me edge .
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire .
what do you seek to express there ?
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the reception desk .
and they may be gone , but they &apos;re never really away , and those are often the people that will tell you , in the beginning it was super hot .
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good .
most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in west africa .
if they liked an aria , they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore , not at the end of the show , but immediately .
popular music , coming along at the same time .
it &apos;s like the guy is sitting next to you , whispering who knows what into your ear .
it might not be what you want to listen to at home , but it works great in the car -- has a huge frequency spectrum , you know , big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle .
we already know where that passion is going .
but i was on an airplane in the east some years ago , and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte , north carolina .
but david changed all of that , and he introduced the iron age to israel .
racism and injustice and violence sweep our world , bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death .
that &apos;s the part of us that yearns for god , or something more than we find in technology .
but i &apos;m -- in a few months , i &apos;ll be 80 years of age .
marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person , and our -- many young people think she &apos;s still alive .
and he said , for the first time in his life he &apos;d thought about the inevitable , and about god .
he was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics , even as a teenager .
i didn &apos;t make good grades in high school .
it is lifeless .
confused , aspiring pacifists .
don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . i carry it within .
faced with absence .
and they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter .
till today , i have no idea where those two girls are .
teen prostitution is at its peak .
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop . &quot;
thank you .
they were able to mobilize young women .
licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the internet .
instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well .
instead , people will have to look at data and search for insight , and as licklider foresaw long ago , the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation , and as kasparov realized , that means minimizing friction at the interface .
one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling .
so i went back to work , and i &apos;ve spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance .
walk the dog .
all of my relationships have failed .
being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
unfortunately , race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff , like parks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste facilities .
but the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community , and i am in between these two worlds , with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other .
what costs are associated with these decisions ? and who pays ?
and they provide habitats for our little friends !
and we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives , incredible things happened .
please don &apos;t waste me . by working together , we can become one of those small , rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world .
as they created their interactive mother &apos;s day cards , you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies .
and that triggered a debate in the u.k .
here &apos;s an example of a project using the microphone .
and it &apos;s in fact working .
so this is an example that came from after i had sent the mother &apos;s day cards to my mom , she decided that she wanted to learn scratch .
rules that say , this is how you handle surfaces ; this is what control is all about ; this is how you show you &apos;re a master of your craft .
we &apos;re not trying to find vanity and beauty .
you want to do cars , you &apos;ve got to go outside .
it turned out it was quite clever because deep blue , in a company like bmw , has a hook -- &quot; deep blue , &quot; wow , cool name .
so we went to tiburon , after three months , and the team had gotten together the week before , many days ahead of time .
i said , &quot; no , &quot; and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife .
you can &apos;t roll a stop sign in cambridge without hitting a graduate student .
when it winds up its genome , why does it not turn into an eye , into a liver , as it has all the genes necessary to do this ?
and so we approached this patient and asked if he would collaborate with us .
for all the reasons you see listed here , we think there &apos;s a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest , conceptually-tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery .
and so i want to thank you for your participation , your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas .
that kind of makes sense to us .
a high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
we want to know -- this is 50 years ago , &quot; surely , &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figured it out by now . &quot;
space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is accelerating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see .
but if you &apos;re boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
and feynman also understood this .
why aren &apos;t we in empty space ?
it &apos;s exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday .
within five months all malawians began to starve to death .
and then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
rather than using a keyboard and mouse , why can i not use my computer in the same way that i interact in the physical world ?
but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing .
so , technically , it &apos;s a little bit complex , but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use , in some sense .
so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i &apos;m touching the paper .
this technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way with maybe a speaker system . &quot;
rio &apos;s a beautiful city , a vibrant place , special place .
we &apos;re like every big city in the world .
it &apos;s the brt , the bus rapid transit .
rio has 6.3 million inhabitants -- more than 20 percent , 1.4 million , live in the favelas .
between november and may , rio &apos;s completely packed .
osario : well traffic tonight is fine .
i don &apos;t need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city .
people agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste .
no , the peacock &apos;s tail results from the mating choices made by peahens .
but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .
but still , one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the beauty we find in skilled performances .
what nfb wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
so for this , we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology .
this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces .
but still , will the society , would they accept such a radical idea ?
this was the beginning . the voice had arrived .
they told me , for example , that if i proved myself worthy of their help , then they could change my life back to how it had been , and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set , a kind of labor of hercules .
ten years after the voice first came , i finally graduated , this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given , and one year later , the highest masters , which shall we say isn &apos;t bad for a madwoman .
it was the first battle that george washington won , in fact , and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
so they would have to have -- these creatures , which i call sunflowers , which i imagine living on the surface of europa , would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight , so they could keep themselves warm on the surface .
in order to concentrate sunlight , they have to have lenses and mirrors -- in order to keep themselves warm .
we transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today .
do they need it ? do they want it in their homes ? &quot;
and it &apos;s done in a very simple way : one just touches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the brightness , and on the other , the coloration of the light .
and hosain rahman , the ceo of aliph jawbone , you know , really understands that you need a different structure .
i mean , they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is .
i was in these venues , and people were , you know , really into getting them . they were excited .
could we have people singing together in real time ?
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .
on the streets chanting , &quot; &#91; hindi &#93; &#91; hindi &#93; we are the women of india .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
improbably , this lgbt singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change , like alchemists turning discord into harmony .
they stood on the side of the road on which charles taylor &apos;s motorcade passed every day .
a filipina activist once said to me , &quot; how do you cook a rice cake ?
thank you .
now what would this mean , and how would we do it ?
a few weeks ago , i had a chance to go to saudi arabia .
because many scholars who study the history of islamic thought -- muslim scholars or westerners -- think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in islam , as muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the middle east .
and we see truly in some muslim communities that tradition .
there is no punishment on apostasy .
so islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the 20th century islamic world .
in 1950 , turkey had the first free and fair elections , which ended the more autocratic secular regime , which was the beginning of turkey .
and i think the getaway message from that would be that islam , despite some of the skeptics in the west , has the potential in itself to create its own way to democracy , create its own way to liberalism , create its own way to freedom .
and it works in a very particular way .
you &apos;ve heard of ssris , which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases .
darfur may have slipped from the news headlines , but the killing and displacement there continues as well , and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom .
thus , even though every civilian killed , maimed , raped , or tortured is one too many , the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
but then , is northern ireland a unique example , or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?
first , leadership .
i wanted to visualize the story of life .
growing living structures under an alien sky ...
it took time for life to break away from water , and it still beckons all the time .
but there were witnesses , survivors in the dark .
and where water is liquid , it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what &apos;s made a difference -- it powers everything .
my girlfriend at the time , who &apos;s no longer my girlfriend — — hated it .
so in 2005 , the campaign got more momentum , was more successful in australia and then new zealand , and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point .
and that makes movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world .
it &apos;s about each person coming to this platform , embracing it in their own way , and being significant in their own life .
benki is a leader of the ashaninka nation .
together , he &apos;s led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers .
you also know that we can &apos;t just keep doing what we &apos;ve always done , because we &apos;ll get the results we &apos;ve always gotten .
not an obvious path , she said to me , &quot; it &apos;s all connected .
this is dr. fan jianchuan .
they &apos;ve gone away from what they did before , and they &apos;ve gone to something they didn &apos;t know .
the two brothers one day decided to go on a race , three times around the world .
this is the root of the clash of civilizations .
that &apos;s what he heard .
when ram dies , krishna is born .
and so , the denominator of alexander &apos;s life was one .
it &apos;s always about my taste .
i even was a business consultant , doing strategies and tactics .
hindus don &apos;t have the concept of commandments .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : understand that you live in the subjective truth , and so does he .
and they are excuses , ladies and gentlemen .
so let &apos;s assume , let &apos;s deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion .
let us merge our interests . &quot;
he mumbled something about his mother , and i told him she &apos;d probably find him outside anyway .
there was something you could have said to your kid when he or she said , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
do you know which group you &apos;re in ?
there &apos;s a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms , and that &apos;s because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret , and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause .
mammograms have been around since the 1960 &apos;s , and it &apos;s changed very little .
now , take a look at this cartoon that accompanied gladwell &apos;s article , and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers .
but mbi exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors , and therefore , it &apos;s impervious to breast density .
we had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose , and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this .
i was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in chicago , and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is .
we &apos;re the new technologists .
those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have .
next question , a little bit harder .
in other words , it &apos;s kind of random , kind of ad hoc , how we figure out what we should do .
when you have two of anything -- two eyes , two ears , two noses , just two protrusions -- those all partake of the form of two .
that sound familiar ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what the calculations are .
hannah arendt said , &quot; the sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil .
find an artist or a writer -- or , heaven forbid , find a philosopher and talk to them .
this is our movie .
maybe the silence .
so even if this object , even if this product includes some technology , it includes some speakers , it includes some microphones and some electronic devices , this object is not a very smart object .
so there can be some biologists , psychiatrists , mathematicians , and so on .
and you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection .
and john maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition .
you have to know , or you probably already know , that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one .
and the plants will filter , by the roots , the dirty water of the fish .
you can see it there .
marijuana &apos;s too cheap , it turns out .
so this is where we enter the picture .
he was such a freak -- and that clipboard probably saved his life , because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard .
that the guys who are running , you know , the local gangs -- the four-square-block by four-square-block areas -- they &apos;re just like the guys , in some sense , who are running the mcdonald &apos;s .
and it actually was the right choice , probably , to try to make it out -- this way .
the first set of people in silicon valley got very , very rich .
it &apos;s why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks , ok ?
paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider , with the possibility to fly cross-country , distance , just with the use of thermals to soar .
two years after this , i was the first to base jump from matterhorn , a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here .
ueli gegenschatz : pretty much . i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly .
do people come to you with projects and say , &quot; we want you to do this ! &quot;
who is the consumer , if you want , and who has responsibility for what one sees ?
&quot; and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take filter into a sense of responsibility ? &quot;
a sort of a run track , or a walk track , on the top of a museum in denmark , which is made of colored glass , going all around .
and &quot; ha-ha , there is a picture and here is i. and what does it matter ? &quot;
in the spectacular large-scale projects he &apos;s famous for , olafur eliasson creates art from a palette of space , distance , color and light . this idea-packed talk begins with an experiment in the nature of perception .
now , this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense .
i &apos;ve been working on a project for the last six years adapting children &apos;s poetry to music .
and the burning question about alma-tadema was : did she marry ?
now , you &apos;ve been kind and ... i &apos;m going to sing this to bill gates .
they &apos;re emotional . they &apos;re aware .
they figured out how it worked .
ssr : you did good . that was very good .
we participate in the apps for apes program orangutan outreach , and we use ipads to help stimulate and enrich the animals , and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals .
forty years ago , bob kahn and i did the design of the internet .
now , there is a project that &apos;s underway called the interplanetary internet .
dr : we &apos;re trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins .
because you have to understand , in israel we don &apos;t talk with people from iran .
they have graphic designers . what ?
because you &apos;re not in the middle east .
and again , something amazing happened , something that we didn &apos;t have on the first wave of the campaign .
and we discovered that we didn &apos;t have to invent it , it already existed in the form of a comic book .
as you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
and with the people &apos;s building , he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of china and the progressive future of china .
copenhagen , shanghai , modern , european .
you &apos;ll walk around , start looking for a bicycle on the roof , jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo .
and we thought , rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars , why don &apos;t we turn all the apartments into penthouses , put them on a podium of cars .
one last example is that recently we , like last summer , we won the competition to design a nordic national bank .
so they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem .
in an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
i &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
these were the bad projects .
it &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of hiv / aids .
and of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
thank you .
instead of liberal democracy , they have de-prioritized the democratic system .
i &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stance .
and instead of shoehorning democracy around the world , perhaps the west should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today .
dambisa moyo : is china the new idol for emerging economies ?
now this does matter .
this is a project we &apos;re working on right now with a very healthy deadline .
but then i met a biologist , and now i think of materials like this -- green tea , sugar , a few microbes and a little time .
and when it &apos;s ready to harvest , you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold , soapy water .
make it hydrophobic .
now , this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt .
everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances , and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural china .
on the train home , she gave me a present : a coach brand change purse with brown leather trim .
later , she married a fellow migrant worker , moved with him to his village , gave birth to two daughters , and saved enough money to buy a secondhand buick for herself and an apartment for her parents .
if you spend enough time , it &apos;s upward , and i met people who had moved to the city 10 years ago , and who are now basically urban middle class people , so the trajectory is definitely upward .
then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
this boy is called zenola .
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers , and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface , but we weren &apos;t really sure .
so if there was this world and this screen , and if there was the physical world around me , i couldn &apos;t ever get them together in the same place .
and 60 hudson in particular is interesting because it &apos;s home to about a half a dozen very important networks , which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect europe and america and connect all of us .
then you can see the english engineers looking on .
because typically they &apos;ve been too inefficient , inaccessible , they &apos;ve not been fast enough , they &apos;ve been quite expensive .
so in some cases , we can abolish totally the need for manual labor .
now 3d printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production .
so today , you can download products from the web -- anything you would have on your desktop , like pens , whistles , lemon squeezers .
and also , you can engage in shape manipulation of that product , but within boundaries that are safe .
but with mri data , we can just build the product , as you can see , very intricately .
america gave them weapons , gave them money , gave them support , encouragement .
opinion polls from all over the muslim world show that there is very little interest among muslims in a global holy war against the west , against the far enemy .
but they have been distracted recently .
he was the especially sadistic head of al qaeda in iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not americans but iraqis . muslims . sunni as well as shiites .
to the real jihad we can say , &quot; welcome back . good luck . &quot;
she started off by telling me her dream . she said , &quot; i had two .
jamii bora understands that and understands that when we &apos;re talking about poverty , we &apos;ve got to look at people all along the economic spectrum .
and just as important , we owe it to ourselves .
now is my book the next great american novel ?
and i really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light .
and i concluded , after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels , different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn &apos;t practical to store energy .
those shapes are parabolas .
and one of the great ones of all time , james watt &apos;s steam engine of 1788 was a major , major breakthrough .
normally , efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine .
so we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible .
so you don &apos;t have to tell what latitude , longitude you &apos;re at , you don &apos;t have to tell what your roof slope angle is , you don &apos;t have to tell what orientation .
it &apos;s a really good combination of those two factors .
there &apos;s 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage , one horsepower is 756 watts , at full power .
and every one of those scientists is in a research group , and every research group studies a wide variety of topics .
and this plane , the model , ba146 , which was run by faam , normally flies 120 to 130 people .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m trying to do , all day long .
and some of the watches there , attempting to be beautiful and humorous -- maybe not attempting , hopefully succeeding .
i never -- i don &apos;t like plots .
so i decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift , it needed a few illustrations .
&quot; as the last dodo was dying , spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything , called eudaemonia .
but then she says tel aviv and lenin , which is the town they came from , and , &quot; sorry , the rest unknown , thank you . &quot;
could we have -- no , we don &apos;t have time .
and i look at a beautiful bowl of fruit , and i look at a dress that i sewed for friends of mine .
so it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the karmapa wasn &apos;t going to come true .
and so , what i think it comes down to is a question of , not only having information of what &apos;s going on , but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive .
let &apos;s summon the best designer , the mother of all designers .
they begin to self-replicate . so in absence of any reward , the intrinsic reward is self-replication .
it &apos;s also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .
we had evolution over time , and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings : 55 percent of people who have become infected with h5n1 have , in fact , succumbed .
if it were los angeles , is it the mayor , the governor , the president of the united states , the head of homeland security ?
encouraging telecommuting ? what works ?
and here is the other interesting thing : when a human being ingests tamiflu , only 20 percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being .
it was likened to the plague .
and i hope i &apos;ve convinced you of that , which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders , and your national leaders , &quot; why haven &apos;t you solved these problems ?
can you talk about that ?
what percentage of infected people were killed by it ?
in 2007 , as the world worried about a possible avian flu epidemic , laurie garrett , author of &quot; the coming plague , &quot; gave this powerful talk to a small university audience . her insights from past pandemics are suddenly more relevant than ever .
now my story has a lot to do with dreaming , although i &apos;m known to make my dreams come true .
the magician looked at me and said , &quot; this is a disaster .
and he finally asked , &quot; can i see those ? &quot;
in the meantime , i am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers , i am my own teacher , progressing in my new art and becoming a street juggler .
decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable .
so i said , now it &apos;s okay . the room is too small .
now the dove , who , now you know , obviously cannot fly , does for the third time a little flop , flop , flop and ends up on the wire behind me .
thank you .
these plants occur in great diversity , over 28,000 species around the world .
i &apos;ve also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives .
they made a fabulous dance called &quot; biome . &quot;
they were very enthusiastic .
in these partnerships , i have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into it people , and movie star people , and scientists , but when we share nature , when we share our perspectives about nature , we find a common denominator .
so , thank you .
this is birgitta jónsdóttir . she &apos;s an icelandic mp .
in a lot of countries , we have official secrets acts , with no public interest test . so that means it &apos;s a crime , people are punished , quite severely in a lot of cases , for publishing or giving away official information .
it was taken 18 years ago .
we know almost nothing about it .
the nitrogen has two problems .
one , they &apos;re quiet , they don &apos;t make any noise .
and usually we &apos;ll have a slightly larger cylinder mounted exterior on the rebreather , like this .
also , when you get down there , you find that the water is very , very clear .
and yes , it &apos;s a little nerve-wracking .
this one we actually first discovered back in the air days -- the bad old air days , as we used to say -- when we were doing these kind of dives with air .
at the beginning i told you that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs .
when i was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school .
like many autistic children , his mind was locked inside his body .
developmental disorders in children are typically diagnosed by observing behavior , but aditi shankardass suggests we should be looking directly at brains . she explains how one eeg technique has revealed mistaken diagnoses and transformed children &apos;s lives .
unfortunately it took so long that lou never saw it finished .
yes , it is the national image of bangladesh .
he cared in a very different manner , but it takes a lot of time to understand that .
are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ?
but , this time not one billion dollars , one billion stars .
and we &apos;re a very young technology in an old galaxy , and we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s possible for technologies to persist .
so , in 1959 , giuseppe coccone and philip morrison published the first seti article in a refereed journal , and brought seti into the scientific mainstream .
so , if that &apos;s right , why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds ?
the ice of antarctica glows with a light so dazzling , it blinds the unprotected eye .
ten times a day , they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow , season after season for thousands of years .
the truth is , we only know the outlines , and what we don &apos;t completely understand , we can &apos;t properly fix .
this was a simple sign error , because it &apos;s cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel , as is well known to companies that do it all the time -- for example , dupont , sd micro electronics .
they &apos;re not going to export your uncle &apos;s buick .
just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem , namely , light vehicles , here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag , and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive .
and it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .
and then another six can be made robustly , competitively , from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel , without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production .
governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year .
we can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil .
we launched a website on september 2nd that has now served 25 million pages , and has 42,000 registered young girl users .
girl 7 : i run track , i played soccer , i play basketball , and i love a lot of things to do .
after this awful event occurs , rocket gets to decide how she feels about it .
i &apos;m going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life .
he painted a beautiful vermeer .
i don &apos;t doubt that that plays some role , but what i want to convince you of today is that there &apos;s something else going on .
they get people into a fmri scanner , and while they &apos;re lying there , through a tube , they get to sip wine .
this was recorded in 1931 .
so for instance , we told some people , &quot; look , you can buy the sweater , but you can &apos;t tell anybody you own it , and you can &apos;t resell it . &quot;
the interesting thing about marla olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 minutes ii into their house to film her painting .
now i &apos;ve been talking so far about pleasure , but what i want to suggest is that everything i &apos;ve said applies as well to pain .
and it &apos;s best understood through example as the science of those crazy , wacky newspaper headlines .
how do you know that something is good for us or bad for us ?
so what we want is studies in real human people .
and no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question .
and you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it &apos;s better than nothing , which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision .
i personally prefer statistics , so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do first .
in fact , 76 percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients .
and i tell them , &quot; it &apos;s the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don &apos;t see . &quot;
nothing . they don &apos;t talk about us . they don &apos;t talk about the coal .
so you have a sense of what the americans are thinking .
poverty , despair , struggle .
you say , &quot; how is that possible ? &quot;
the solution to the problem in the middle east , according to him , is to convert you all to christianity -- just get rid of your religion .
i mean , of course , this is how americans take it , so people all over the middle east , not just in your country , are protesting .
you see , i , sam richards , i know who these guys are .
she &apos;s my sister , my wife , my cousin , my neighbor .
can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks ?
you can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person &apos;s driving 40 miles per hour in the passing lane , or your teenage son , or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on sunday mornings .
here are some data on tariffs : starting at 40 percent , coming down to less than 5 percent .
growth was negative .
so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people .
the united states has been an idea leader .
investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas .
in fact in the second half of the 20th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the 20th century .
after two days here , i declare myself boggled , and enormously impressed , and feel that you are one of the great hopes -- not just for american achievement in science and technology , but for the whole world .
consider the nematode roundworm , the most abundant of all animals .
as we move past the relatively gigantic mammals , birds , frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity ?
sadly , our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered .
today , the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia , regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it , are within reach .
but a lot of other animals weren &apos;t saved .
all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue , because down in there is what is called ancient dna .
so this meeting in boston led to three things .
at the san diego zoo , his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species over the last 35 years .
the california condor was down to 22 birds in 1987 .
you can do the same thing , as the costs come down , for the carolina parakeet , for the great auk , for the heath hen , for the ivory-billed woodpecker , for the eskimo curlew , for the caribbean monk seal , for the woolly mammoth .
so throughout my childhood , my mother was incarcerated and i didn &apos;t have my father because i didn &apos;t even learn his first name until i was in the sixth grade .
my book had a title page .
so how did i make friends ?
i just wanted a video camera .
and my grandfather would call me every week , and he would say , &quot; jarrett , how &apos;s it going ? do you have a job yet ? &quot;
for a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo .
thank you .
and the quality of sleep is degraded , and so is our recovery .
now that education you would receive , and thanks to the british acoustician adrian james for those simulations . the signal was the same , the background noise was the same .
and that &apos;s free out of that conference .
i love the idea that you can transform , become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective .
all right . let &apos;s start with theater .
and that usually , if you &apos;re a bit extraordinary , if you &apos;re not exactly of human appearance , then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .
charlie chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music , silence , humor and poetry .
but i also met aluminum mold makers , ammunition producers and all kinds of people .
but i didn &apos;t want you to miss out on this one , because this , well , it &apos;s called &quot; portion-controlled meat cuts . &quot;
it &apos;s really a sort of magical moment .
everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
i wondered , how am i going to take this group in nine months from where they are to where they need to be ?
i said , &quot; and when we review this , won &apos;t you do better ? &quot;
but it is not impossible .
you have to say , &quot; sam dined , &quot; not , &quot; sam dined the pizza . &quot;
to drive the car only causes something to go , because chicago &apos;s not the kind of thing that can possess something .
now , i &apos;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot; fargo . &quot;
well , what does this have to do with language ?
and then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language , i think we can get a window onto what makes us tick .
even before that , what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that kant &apos;s theory works or mill &apos;s the right ethicist to follow ?
that &apos;s the kind of argument we want .
and you answer my objection .
i don &apos;t have an answer .
they paddle faster , and faster , and faster , until they &apos;re going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they &apos;re standing upright , sort of paddling the top of the water .
and they didn &apos;t know that .
so what can we learn about making -- not just computers , but everything ?
at all .
a woman named joanna aizenberg , at lucent , is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses . she &apos;s also looking at fiber optics .
separation technologies are going to be extremely important .
that &apos;s the biggest design challenge .
it builds soil ; it cleans air ; it cleans water ; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and i need to live .
business , she said , was critical to her country &apos;s future .
if you see the word &quot; microfinance , &quot; what comes to mind ?
and that &apos;s just to start .
my mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold tupperware at night so that i could have every opportunity possible .
but it was a little bit boring .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
so what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize .
except for flooring .
we gotta kill them because they &apos;re making a mess .
we &apos;re seeing a population boom with crows .
for example , in sweden , crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice .
so , they &apos;re learning from each other . and research bears this out .
and we move to the third stage , where we only give them a coin .
or maybe do search and rescue ?
and on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line , the employees of electrolux in greenville , michigan , had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper .
because after all , if you look at the context , 1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally , and every dollar represents a job , and where are those jobs going ?
what if we created a private sector challenge to the governors ?
and in the last three years , we &apos;ve been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed , and we &apos;ve discovered some very interesting things .
if you look at the statistics -- these are worldwide statistics -- in every single age category , women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies .
they listen and mimic and remix what they like .
i &apos;ll line the bottom with old notebook pages .
i &apos;ll listen for what &apos;s missing , and i &apos;ll put it there .
and the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene .
very unsettling for people working in pathology labs .
i love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation .
i actually found three separate recipes in the literature .
so this may be sort of titillating for her . here we go .
okay , with women , a lot of this is happening inside .
mary roach : 10 things you didn &apos;t know about orgasm
however , i also have reason to believe that many , if not most , of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly .
this is a little hard for children , but i think you can handle it .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day .
we are only happy when things are in order .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
and i started to bring some order into some flags .
and i would ask him every once in a while , &quot; dad , do you want it to sound like the record ? &quot;
and for decades , i &apos;m going , why does this happen ? what can i do about it ? how can i change this ? i mean there must be something .
i choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element .
intent is a marker for civilization .
he came out of nowhere .
reality itself needed a designer .
he goes , &quot; hey , mister ! mister ! &quot;
you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
i didn &apos;t see abed coming .
each of us had a before and an after .
it was approaching 11 when i exited right toward afula , and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara .
abed then rose and turned on the tv so that i wouldn &apos;t be alone when he left the room , and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver &apos;s license .
some , as had abed , would forget the date .
people don &apos;t know that they have lived through worse , that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck , that problems of the mind are greater still , more injurious , than a hundred broken necks .
i developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved , on lower power , which enabled the walking biped robots , the first androids .
and there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re sleeping , at 7.7 hours .
there &apos;s currently over a thousand tedtalks on the ted website .
we could have been done by lunch here .
he &apos;s got eight talks online , and those talks can basically be summed up into just four words , because that &apos;s all he &apos;s basically showing us , our intuition is really bad .
or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping tedtalk : &quot; flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer . &quot;
i &apos;m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts .
when the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found .
so particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
and without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes .
you see , when we speak of the big bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
so astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static , inky , black stillness .
maybe some of these conversations can continue .
and you &apos;re able to interact with his world .
milo : i could just squish it .
how do you skim stones ?
now &apos;s a chance for dimitri to kind of reassure and calm milo down .
the cool thing is that we &apos;re doing as well : as you interact with him , you &apos;re able to put things into his world ; he recognizes objects .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
and there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes .
i &apos;m not even a humanitarian aid doctor , and i can &apos;t tell you the times of how helpless i &apos;ve felt to have people dying in front of me , and i couldn &apos;t save them .
my son calls this &quot; making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned a.m. station . &quot;
she can scratch her back , she can scratch one of us , she can play another game .
and that &apos;s a picture that every neurophysiologist knows .
so they told me that it &apos;s impossible to make someone walk .
turns out that dai manju was the best pupil in her grade .
in the 19th century , it was slavery .
poverty , for instance .
now , modern slavery : according to state department rough statistics , there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders .
they ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night .
the merchants liked her embroidery ; it sold very well , and they kept asking for more .
she rocketed to the top of her class .
one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself .
and just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood , you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else &apos;s brain to suit your interests .
because this is exactly what our ancestors , the homo erectus , did .
because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it &apos;s fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
let &apos;s imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads , but you &apos;re hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached .
language really is the voice of our genes .
our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past .
svante found that the foxp2 gene , which seems to be associated with language , was also shared in the same form in neanderthals as us .
it &apos;s titled , &quot; an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar , &quot; and it &apos;s comprised of nearly 70 images .
and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting , so i spent some time with the smells and items .
and the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth .
and in 2004 , they developed a channel called alhurra iraq , which specifically deals with events occurring in iraq and is broadcast to iraq .
the scene of arrest , the scene of misidentification , the alibi location .
and it reiterates that distortion is a constant , and our eyes are easily deceived .
so the first idea i had , initially , was just to go the federal and state governments and go , &quot; here , take it , for free . &quot;
now , this isn &apos;t new . anyone who &apos;s used google earth has seen this before , but one thing we like to say in our group is , we do the opposite of google earth .
granted , we don &apos;t have everything in between , because some of the data is hard to get .
and here &apos;s the thing . now you know how it got there .
some people say this is because we have better diagnosis , and more people are being found out .
if we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive .
they love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones .
it &apos;s also crinkling the outer corner of the eye , the orbicularis oculi .
and that &apos;s really mediated by the sex hormones .
and then this kid over here is saying , &quot; leave me alone with my toys . &quot;
africa was truly fascinating for me .
rats have been used since the &apos; 50s last century , in all kinds of experiments .
they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
a cage like this -- a cage like this -- provided that you have rats , and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this , operating throughout the day , can process 1,680 samples .
i &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the university of california .
but what rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when i &apos;m looking at somebody else performing the same action .
now there is another kind of mirror neuron , which is involved in something quite different .
and this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
that &apos;s about a 50th of a millimeter .
and this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm .
but pollen forensics can be very subtle .
so it &apos;s a woman &apos;s disease now .
we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women .
so a tremendous fund of knowledge despite , again , that so many people told her not to do it , it was too expensive .
and because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat .
we selected this for the research .
why are there women and men ?
but we cannot stop now .
and we feed them -- sterilely of course -- with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food -- and we grow them in incubators .
it &apos;s about the size of a mini marshmallow .
imogen heap plays a powerful stripped-down version of &quot; wait it out , &quot; from her new record , ellipse .
baby : gagagagagaga gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water .
so welcome to my home .
this is the wordscape for the word water , and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen .
this is a subset of data from our database -- just 50,000 out of several million -- and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources .
and i think the implications here are profound , whether it &apos;s for science , for commerce , for government , or perhaps most of all , for us as individuals .
deb roy : the birth of a word
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation .
secondly , making them interactive .
this is a laundry chute , and this right here is a shoe last .
but i get a lot of toilets , and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer , and then you have lumpy tiles .
but you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
and in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives .
if you buy a two-by-four and it &apos;s not straight , you can take it back .
so we have the american dream look-alike , which is a mobile home .
how disgusting .
the last thing is gregariousness .
and it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal , terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity , but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources .
everywhere i went , i felt at home .
the show began with tremendous special effects , because there were catastrophic climate shifts -- which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today .
the world health organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on earth in terms of years lived with disability .
this is now flash-forward to the point in time where i &apos;ve been discharged by the health system .
full-scale i.q. is the mental processing -- how fast you can acquire information , retain it and retrieve it -- that is essential for success in life today .
but that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
using this technology , this is mapping in three dimensions .
i don &apos;t have the ability to control my left foot .
so i think this one detail went past people really quick .
i should clarify that .
well , i first discovered that the textbook was tintin , mainly .
let &apos;s move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income . this is the world distribution of income of people .
but a huge difference between afghanistan and sri lanka .
because the data is hidden down in the databases .
what has happened is this : that china is growing , it &apos;s not so equal any longer , and it &apos;s appearing here , overlooking the united states .
and my mother was irish catholic , and -- but she didn &apos;t take religion too seriously .
and there was an unexpected speaker who wasn &apos;t on the program , and he talked about dna .
and so we didn &apos;t build any models , and francis sort of continued to work on proteins .
but wilkins said &quot; no . &quot; rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months , and after she left he would start building models .
most scientists are really rather dull .
well , at that time -- i should go back .
and you can see here , there are a lot of them .
gooseberry owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email .
no counter offer .
and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system .
so we had a dance , and girls and their fathers came in multitudes .
because one thing he did know , that when fathers are connected to their children , it is less likely that they will return .
angela patton : a father-daughter dance ... in prison
finally , a vaccine that could stop this awful disease , and here in the united states it had an incredible impact .
so i want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership , the polio partnership , is trying to do .
and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries .
they &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
umar also has polio .
and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world .
and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years .
it sounds like a lot of money ; it is a lot of money .
it was frightening , and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell .
we actually managed to drown two million dollars &apos; worth of camera gear .
and i do believe you should stay with us .
but nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hunting .
bj : and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000 .
so this is not just a concern about lions ; it &apos;s a concern about communities in africa as well .
the biologist lewis wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example . science , as opposed to technology , does violence to common sense .
he started walking . what am i mostly made of ? atoms .
not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place . matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .
a dog that had never met capric acid would , perhaps , have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet , say , playing one note higher than we &apos;ve heard a trumpet play before .
and , similarly , a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the lorenz contraction , and so on , to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking -- get children into the way of thinking about it .
i went to notre dame university and graduated with degrees in accounting and german , including spending a year of study in austria .
all of us have disabilities in one form or another .
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
as the frequencies increase , so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate .
well , there is still a lot to explore in its early days . and there &apos;s not many people working in this field .
it gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice .
now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
they believe that 24 percent of american twitter users are african-american .
if i walk into a store in the united states , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in fiji , shipped at great expense to the united states .
and you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
you probably won &apos;t .
and so the people who founded foko club in madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
and my question to you is : if yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the english internet into chinese , where &apos;s the english language yeeyan ?
i know amira .
it &apos;s called &quot; dhani tackles the globe . &quot;
so the teacher rings up the parents , and says , &quot; very shocking story from little billy today .
why should we get away from those arguments ?
chinese restaurants have played an important role in american history , as a matter of fact .
theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste , so they &apos;re not as sweet as our version .
believe it or not , these guys were actually crossing the road .
and not the most pc question to be asked today , but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time , not so outlandish .
this is , like , this is something that in the chinese version has no soup .
so , what &apos;s interesting is that their stories were similar , but they were different .
but it has to be technological , so i &apos;ll talk about electroshock therapy .
so they plugged him in again , and this time they used 110 volts for half a second .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
and they tried everything they had .
and so we &apos;ll lose a little time . big deal . it doesn &apos;t make any difference . &quot;
we had two more children after that .
there is redemption . and there is resurrection .
but you &apos;ve got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally , and the problems that we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone .
gb : modern communications .
but they are now out of date . they don &apos;t deal with the problems .
gb : is that not what we &apos;re doing in the debate about climate change ?
and that &apos;s a big task : persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so .
and the material looks something like this .
so we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there .
or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some silk led tattoos .
so it allows for the recovery of what we &apos;ve stored before .
and also i can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions .
&quot; come on buddy , i have the toe clippers right here .
you &apos;ve been a great audience .
the question is , what can i do with you ?
strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now , that enables me to find the sources of intimacy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
and it &apos;s not a banal story -- after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the &apos; 70s .
and in my head i would be thinking that &quot; doing &quot; a war meant being a soldier .
during that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15 .
but demand was ever-growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents .
she explained that the father that she &apos;d had would tell them he &apos;d come and pick them up on sunday to go for a walk .
my father watched , benevolently , of course , the demonstrations of the month of may , but his heart was elsewhere , and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve .
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .
you can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well-being -- nitrous oxide , methane , deforestation , overfishing land degredation , loss of species -- they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years .
now we to ask ourselves : which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the holocene ?
we have to invest in persistence , in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup .
and what shall we do ?
you know , when i was a teenager , i was a creator .
because when i decided to go into advertising , i wanted to do -- i wanted to airbrush naked people on ice , for whiskey commercials , that &apos;s what i really wanted to do .
but i was still , you know -- this is a kitty cloud .
these always end up being a photograph at the end , or more like an etching in this case .
like , you know , you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor .
this is a pipe .
if we compare my genome to the genome of you , approximately every 1,200 , 1,300 letters will differ between us .
we either live inside africa today , or in quite recent exile .
it &apos;s easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them .
presumably , they did so first in the middle east , where there were neanderthals living .
we learn perhaps many things , but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think the lesson is that we have always mixed .
these people have different needs .
push this idea a little bit forward .
we &apos;re always in this stance of being the object of somebody else &apos;s subjectivity .
as babies engage with caregivers , they soon realize that , well , there is something in between the ears that is very important -- it &apos;s invisible , you can &apos;t see -- but is really critical , and that thing is called attention .
well , autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders , and it &apos;s a brain disorder .
so how do we do that ?
it &apos;s very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people , but it has no traction .
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you .
there &apos;s no way to get out of this at this point . &quot;
now the army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet , your calves , your thighs , your buttocks and your push-up muscles .
but in my first 25 years of career , i had a bunch of different experiences .
and that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
then another thing .
it &apos;s probably more powerful than marriage vows .
i was interested in the idea of why and how i could create a new story , a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world .
and i bring this up because it &apos;s important to locate this practice in history .
for me , it is about re-imagining this cultural discourse in an international context .
they downloaded it from disney.com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
this is a 15 year-old boy .
they all came in there , and i told them that there &apos;s some really difficult stuff on this computer .
so i found that they had a friend , a local accountant , a young girl , and they played football with her .
the first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes .
children : you can &apos;t catch me .
fifteen minutes later -- next question : where is calcutta ?
and when i &apos;m in the turbulent times , as we know , that i am right now , through the crucible and the fire of transformation , which is what all of you do , actually .
they needed the light to see .
but the beauty of it is that it &apos;s just silk and sticks .
prospera : caliban !
pp : rise above yourself and take control . george tsypin : we &apos;re looking at new york from a spider-man point of view .
i &apos;m in thongs and sarongs . it was many years ago .
and the women said , &quot; you know , jacqueline , who in nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall american woman ? &quot; and like -- -- it &apos;s a good point .
i think andrew pretty well covered that , so i will move to the third point , which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .
and even when we explained that if abe goes away , all those 7,500 jobs go away too , we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social .
and so , from an enterprise perspective for africa , and from a public health perspective , these are real successes .
but because she had the opportunity of the marketplace , and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education , her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams .
and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
okay , so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .
i think our enemy was physics -- and she &apos;s a cruel mistress .
i mean , &quot; curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
so all we need is one finger . just wipe off and we see the elephant .
they were developed in japan pretty recently .
these systems are really hard to build , but we &apos;re just starting to be able to get there , and so , watch out .
so , that &apos;s the stage out of all this . i find , for reasons i don &apos;t understand , i really do have a goal .
and we &apos;re working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span -- and an intermediate-size , one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day , feed it back at night , and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time .
but now , as they say in infomercials , we have something much better for you , which we &apos;re working on : planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size .
things are going on this decade , next decade ; it &apos;s a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do .
australians , we don &apos;t mind a bit of a drink , sometimes to excess , leading to embarrassing social situations .
and today , i want to show you one of those musical notes , a number so beautiful , so massive , i think it will blow your mind .
- 1 = 2,047 , and you don &apos;t need me to tell you that &apos;s 23 x 89 .
he went on and on and calculated 67 powers of two .
i was doing my breakfast radio show .
let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful .
it wasn &apos;t my highlight of 2012 .
many of you might be familiar with taz , the cartoon character , the one that spins around and around and around .
her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
so cancer could be thought of as a strange , short-lived , self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end .
when the devil bites another devil , it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil , so the tumor continues to grow .
ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .
that means that out of five married couples , two will end up splitting their assets .
how interesting are you ?
next time they will do better .
in fact , without the optimism bias , we would all be slightly depressed .
and indeed they did -- but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected .
and if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future , you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on .
so they have adjusted the 2012 olympic budget for the optimism bias .
the other is power diffusion , the way power is moving from all states west or east to non-state actors .
but the stage is crowded .
now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what &apos;s happening there .
there are often bumps along the road , accidents along the way .
no , i think that &apos;s wrong .
now i don &apos;t mean to be pollyannaish about this .
the first principle is : it &apos;s the politics that matters .
and that doesn &apos;t produce a productive politics .
it &apos;s got to reform economic policy .
one is jobs .
during conflict people are doing destruction .
one advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently .
so that &apos;s the focus on the construction sector .
and how will they cope in a foreign land ?
imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue .
san francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment , as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater , causing backups at the plant , harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste .
let &apos;s start with beatle mania : hysterical teenagers , crying , screaming , pandemonium .
why english ? in a single word : opportunity .
and now english is becoming the language of problem-solving .
and then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye .
and then luria went to another person , and he said to them , &quot; there are no camels in germany .
you can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
well , the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss , but they were cognitively very agile .
they would not take the hypothetical seriously , and without the hypothetical , it &apos;s very difficult to get moral argument off the ground .
there are other parts of the i.q. test battery that are about using logic on abstractions .
lord curzon once said he saw people bathing in the north sea , and he said , &quot; why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have ? &quot;
the project i &apos;m going to tell you about is called the world peace game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
so this happened in 1978 , and i was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
you know that teacher ?
and so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot plexiglass structure .
and they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
it &apos;s impossible . their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and i admit it to them openly .
it came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
jh : i get chills every time i see that .
everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
i &apos;ve been making toys for the last 30 years .
and it was a turning point .
why use triangles ?
well since then , i just thought that i &apos;ve been really privileged to go to over 2,000 schools in my country -- village schools , government schools , municipal schools , ivy league schools -- i &apos;ve been invited by most of them .
right .
if you want to put a colored disk , well all these seven colors coalesce .
this program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools .
wool sticks on velcro .
and this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird .
and all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves .
secondly , shifting from a linear , wasteful , polluting way of using resources to a closed-loop model .
so i think the eden project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency -- delivering the same function , but with a fraction of the resource input .
and the kind of elements i &apos;m talking about are , firstly , we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse , a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas .
between them there &apos;s a waxy finish which repels water .
and finally , in the shade under the mirrors , it &apos;s possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight .
so returning to those big challenges that i mentioned at the beginning : radical increases in resource efficiency , closing loops and a solar economy .
and if i want to start having children by the time i &apos;m 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago .
as i &apos;m signing on to the various dating websites , as it happens , i was really , really busy .
so i said , fine , from here on out i &apos;m only going on dates where i know that there &apos;s wi-fi , and i &apos;m bringing my laptop .
so i now have these 72 different data points , which , to be fair , is a lot .
i didn &apos;t carry on crazy catfish-style relationships with anybody .
they all looked really great , which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had uploaded .
they should be fluffy , not hard . &quot;
one first saying that i &apos;m sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse .
&#91; &quot; yellow &quot; &#93; db : red . audience : yellow .
the other one is the frontal lobe , which controls how we sustain attention , and another one is the anterior cingulate , which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict .
that &apos;s another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain .
there is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can &apos;t resist .
so let &apos;s try changing the rule for this program a little bit .
the only way to find its outcome is , effectively , just to watch it evolve .
let &apos;s say the revenue of microsoft .
and if you look at things like the iphone app , the fraction is considerably larger .
i mean , anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language .
if the rules for the universe are simple , it &apos;s kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level ; operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things .
stay here . i &apos;ve got a question .
so what the western countries , developed countries , have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in third world countries who actually can &apos;t afford these medications .
so this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place .
why did she say that ?
i talked to my father . i did something that most girls have never done .
three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse .
so i went back and i had to go back to the tradition .
those things made me angry .
we gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years .
there was nothing to buy , unless you wanted to buy some rivets . right ?
and you &apos;ve got to admit , over the course of the last year and a half , consumers have been doing some pretty weird things .
the management principle is dollars and cents .
so , really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand .
they are digging in . and they &apos;re looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make .
so , the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold .
you have to realize that you can &apos;t fight and control this .
it will drive innovation .
why were other people blocking it ?
so , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
a week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
what she didn &apos;t know was that i thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself .
when i ran out of the building at three in the morning , i saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
yet as much as i love stories , recently , i &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
it was only because of our passports .
fiction is flowing water .
it &apos;s between buildings .
we &apos;re going to begin in 1964 .
don &apos;t worry about tunes . take a tune , sing high when they sing low , sing fast when they sing slow , and you &apos;ve got a new tune . &quot;
let &apos;s hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology .
we have no such aversion towards copying what other people have , because we do that nonstop .
he leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
so , let &apos;s never forget , whether at ted , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
so it isn &apos;t in the series .
and again , we had to fly to the jovian system to get any sense that this moon , as most moons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock .
so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , i think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over .
there &apos;s one more , i think , wonderful twist to that tale .
now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the big bang .
it &apos;s currently 10 billion miles away from earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we &apos;re still in contact with it .
brian cox : why we need the explorers
and the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me , but i have no idea who they are .
at the same time i installed my own collusion profile , i installed one for my daughter .
and i said , &quot; thank you for being here . &quot;
i called my parents up .
well , that lasted 17 years .
so i did that .
what are you going to do with a master &apos;s degree ? &quot;
he said , &quot; you just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot;
and i started walking off .
we have to change now .
it was the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life .
i could die of starvation like my father in north korea , or at least i could try for a better life by escaping to china .
i decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
many people helped me along the way to get here .
ah : sure , please .
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
two tribes , hutu and tutsi , fought each other .
and also i still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty .
i proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because l &apos;aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
thank you .
one researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of charlie brown &apos;s teacher in the old &quot; peanuts &quot; cartoon .
the offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot-flavored cereal , and from the looks of it , they seemed to enjoy it more .
soon food became scarce , with many dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day -- a quarter of what they consumed before the war .
this is what happened to the children of the dutch &quot; hunger winter . &quot;
and the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
follow the archetypes of narrative fiction .
we think in narrative structures .
tm : thank you .
it &apos;s the lift , it &apos;s a series of buttons in the lift .
actually , what happens in the world increasingly -- now , all credit to the british airport authority .
and there &apos;s to some extent a big strategy myth that &apos;s prevalent in business now .
so the first thing i &apos;d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
but it sort of creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny , tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology .
but actually , to me , what &apos;s almost more interesting than either of these two products is how people actually found out about them .
i imagined in my head , a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away , that would always be with us .
so as i did this , and as i think many of us do this , we kind of buy our distance , we kind of buy our right to go on with our day .
and they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives , like they would start to send their children to school .
in october of &apos; 05 , after those first seven loans were paid , matt and i took the word beta off of the site .
kiva borrowers , as i interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years , have taught me what entrepreneurship is .
so the mapping of participating in the story , it actually flows with the up and down .
and i believe more and more every time i listen in that that person &apos;s potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help .
we have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions .
furthermore , despite an extensive search by the seti project , we haven &apos;t heard any alien television quiz shows .
we will take it as a salutary warning , i think , for the rest of our conference this week .
thank you .
that &apos;s a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card , okay ?
suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company .
now , let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime , and that is , seti , i think , is important , because it &apos;s exploration , and it &apos;s not only exploration , it &apos;s comprehensible exploration .
and yet we &apos;re spending billions of swiss francs on this problem .
in fact , this reminds me , i don &apos;t know , a couple years ago i gave a talk at a school in palo alto where there were about a dozen 11-year-olds that had come to this talk .
selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl who lived and died 3.3 million years ago .
with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks , i made my way .
what you have here seems to be nothing , but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human .
but to do that , you need the permanent dentition , which you don &apos;t see here , because what you have here are the baby teeth .
this is called the hyoid bone . it &apos;s a bone which is right here .
needless to list them here , and there are more competent people to talk about this .
and then finally , we &apos;re going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that &apos;s rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation , but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect .
the sargasso sea , for example , is not a sea bounded by coastlines , but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there .
getting closer to shore , where we are , this was in fact taken in the galapagos .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
and she wanted to make something of her life , and she asked me a simple little question .
goldie hawn says , &quot; i always had self-doubts .
what first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by derek k. miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
but what i think comes next is far more interesting .
they &apos;ve taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun .
and then he goes back to his quarters , breaks down and weeps because he &apos;s convinced that the situation is hopeless .
so it &apos;ll show you gdp per capita , population , longevity , that &apos;s about it .
the complexity here is unbelievable .
so let &apos;s say you wanted to make detergent .
you see how this works , right ?
you think it &apos;s obvious ?
nevertheless , archie managed to get permission to do this .
and you sometimes need to be shocked out of that .
yes , we are a brilliant and creative species , but we &apos;ve created a little too much stuff -- so much that our economy is now bigger than its host , our planet .
that &apos;s not possible .
but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it &apos;s dangerously wrong , because it means we &apos;re not getting ready for what &apos;s really going to happen .
we tend to look at the world , not as the integrated system that it is , but as a series of individual issues .
perhaps anger .
scientists like james hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net co2 emissions from the economy in just a few decades .
we can choose life over fear .
oops .
let me show you what it looks like .
and we &apos;ve got to end up with a smaller government .
craig venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert dna and have it boot up as a different species .
four years ago , i showed you this picture .
but , i mean it gets more interesting .
in the last olympics , this gentleman , who had several world records in the special olympics , tried to run in the normal olympics .
it is common for hominids to evolve .
and the problem with this cure was it was very expensive , and it was very complicated to use .
and the free cure is adult seatbelts , and the expensive cure -- the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure -- is child car seats .
and so if we look at recent crashes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years &apos; worth of data -- you won &apos;t see it in the recent crashes . the new car seats are far , far better . &quot;
these are three-year-old dummies , by the way .
and if you think from a design perspective , about going back to square one , and say , &quot; i just want to protect kids in the back seat . &quot;
( audience : i just wanted to ask you , when we wear seatbelts we don &apos;t necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life , it &apos;s also to prevent lots of serious injury .
first of all , it was impossible , and it &apos;s not what it was .
that &apos;s a lot of storage , memory . nine exabyte ram .
and the cloudbook doesn &apos;t have any storage .
so that the laws of media , such as the fact that copies have no value , the value &apos;s in the uncopiable things , the immediacy , the authentication , the personalization .
the second stage that we &apos;re in now is the idea of linking pages .
so that &apos;s what you want , is all your friends are identified , and you should just carry these relationships around .
but when six billion humans are googling , who &apos;s searching who ? it goes both ways .
to share is to gain . let the one read it .
and we would come in and talk to them , usually for about a week .
in 1974 , i was young , i was naive , and i was pretty lost in my world .
thom mayne : howard ? i &apos;m sitting next to howard . i don &apos;t know howard , obviously , and he &apos;s going , i hope you &apos;re not next .
there &apos;s been a continual relationship between inventions , which are private , and reality , which has been important to me .
architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place .
and then the skin starts transforming into other materials .
and i understood that building really could be the augmentation of the earth &apos;s surface , and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense .
and that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion , broken up by a series of courts , and it &apos;s five acres of uninterrupted , horizontal space for their administrative offices .
and it led us to the project , the courthouse , which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse .
we carry in our face the proof that cooking , food transformation , made us what we are .
we walked out of africa two times .
and two tastes which protect you -- bitter and sour , which are against poisonous and rotten material .
it penetrates the mucosa .
you have stop signals -- we have up to eight stop signals .
now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting , that it can go through the passage of the intestine , it would generate stronger signals .
we are all cut from the same genetic cloth .
and with the blessing of trulshik rinpoche , we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination , accompanied by a great doctor .
and at 48 , i was the only outsider ever to go through this , only one to finish it .
all that time , the world only exists as an abstraction , as they are taught the values of their society .
and i said , &quot; danilo , you won &apos;t remember this , but when you were an infant , i carried you on my back , up and down the mountains . &quot;
now , if we slip to another end of the world , i was up in the high arctic to tell a story about global warming , inspired in part by the former vice president &apos;s wonderful book .
these peoples are not failed attempts at being modern -- quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law .
and because these materials are so prolific , because they &apos;re found in so many places , there &apos;s one other place you &apos;ll find this material , styrene , which is made from benzene , a known carcinogen .
and because they &apos;re made of natural materials , they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard .
so in front of your eyes , this part just self-assembled .
good afternoon .
superfluids are one of the most fragile things we &apos;ve ever discovered .
but just as quickly as they explode , more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer , so it &apos;s constantly changing just to remain exactly the same .
rather than dancing our ph.ds , we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems .
they &apos;ll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them .
here &apos;s one -- a head , followed by a tail , followed by a tail .
ok , who hasn &apos;t voted yet ? because that &apos;s really naughty -- i said you had to .
it &apos;s the same for the first two parts of the sequence .
the natural thing to do after you &apos;ve done that -- and that &apos;s what this project , the international hapmap project , which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries .
that &apos;s what you might think .
those of you in britain will know about what &apos;s become rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally clark , who had two babies who died suddenly .
nonetheless , that &apos;s how it was presented , and at trial nobody even argued it .
many cases were reviewed .
forensic scientists said , &quot; the chance that this guy &apos;s innocent is one in three million . &quot;
hmmm ...
thank you .
so , basically the &quot; internet &quot; has two internets .
and now the result is very simple .
but 99 percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the embassy &apos;s side .
we had a petition system . it &apos;s a remedy outside the judicial system , because the chinese central government wants to keep a myth : the emperor is good . the old local officials are thugs .
that means from the very beginning , weibo has already convinced the chinese government , we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime .
something you find is , freedom is weird .
only in this way , in the future , we will achieve the dreams of the mouse : that we can tweet anytime , anywhere , without fear .
as a musician , i can tell you that if i had to have a cochlear implant , i &apos;d be heartbroken . i &apos;d just be plainly heartbroken , because i know that music would never sound the same to me .
but here is that same girl who is implanted now .
however , despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language , you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can &apos;t hear music almost at all .
now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation .
go ahead and play that .
and this is of a student of mine named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
i chose the gun .
and most of the time , he told me this story i &apos;m going to share with you now .
it was then that i decided i would take up the gun -- for those men and women who came to liberate us -- from the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil .
now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel .
i stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us .
a computer magician can write this thing .
so that &apos;s dna origami . that &apos;s one way . there are many ways of casting molecular spells using dna .
often what happens is you &apos;re planning so hard for like , &quot; how do i get through the hardest part ? how do i get through the hardest part ? &quot;
beginning guys , it &apos;s like , they thrash , they thrash , they get 15 feet up -- and they can do about 15 pull-ups right -- and then they just flame out .
but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty , and i &apos;m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
these are all logarithmic graphs , so as you go up the levels it represents , generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100 .
but moore &apos;s law , which is very often identified with this exponential growth , is just one example of many , because it &apos;s basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology .
unlike gertrude stein &apos;s roses , it &apos;s not the case that a transistor is a transistor .
they didn &apos;t get diabetes ; they didn &apos;t get heart disease ; they lived 20 percent longer ; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction .
they put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats -- it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion , and actually cures type 1 diabetes .
e-commerce has been growing exponentially . it &apos;s now a trillion dollars .
&quot; experience beamers , &quot; i call them , will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the internet .
this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls , especially if you &apos;re at a golf course and you check under enough bushes .
a type ii error is not believing a pattern is real when it is .
see , our pattern detection device , which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex -- it &apos;s our little detection device there -- can be easily fooled , and this is the problem .
and those who scored high on the esp scale , tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns .
if it &apos;s too low , you &apos;re more likely to make too many type ii errors .
of course , thanks to the environmentalist movement we &apos;re all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals .
in a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
but this is a pattern detection problem , isn &apos;t it ?
or you can do it through loss of consciousness , by accelerating in a centrifuge .
okay , now i &apos;m going to ask you to pucker up .
still exists back home .
but this , surely , whoever that man is , whatever he &apos;s done , this is cruel and unusual punishment .
and this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource .
so how do we test that ? well , that &apos;s easy .
so what you &apos;re looking at here is a heat image of the system , and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball .
and he doesn &apos;t like this first position , but he comes up with a second position , and about 50 minutes later , that nest is finished , and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets .
it starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food , but it is clearly completely lost .
the songs are a little similar , but mostly i &apos;m just interested in the idea that someday maybe we &apos;ll buy a song because we like the way it looks .
now , we &apos;ve all seen a lot of tedtalks online , so let &apos;s watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on .
but he was credited with coining the phrase , &quot; because it &apos;s there . &quot;
beyond that , i didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
and our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been . there certainly isn &apos;t much call for explorers nowadays . my career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option .
so the most important thing is integrity .
so you &apos;ve got to know your market .
people who are vcs or angels investing in you have had experience and they &apos;d like to know that you want to hear that experience .
start with telling them what the market is .
that shows me that -- if you can &apos;t even do a presentation , how the heck can you run a company ?
what do you do ?
and i want to know the market -- the size of the market .
we &apos;re going to have 1,000 customers this year , and 10,000 next year .
what do you think i &apos;m looking at ?
thinking startup ? david s. rose &apos;s rapid-fire u talk on pitching to a venture capitalist tells you the 10 things you need to know about yourself -- and prove to a vc -- before you fire up your slideshow .
in fact , for years , the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about 15 meters per year , and nobody told me that .
like my next link : the chemical language of pheromones .
pan troglodytes , the name we give him , means &quot; cave dweller . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know that .
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
in fact , we devalue play .
i &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
controlling -- you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so i &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
they can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
for example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
he &apos;s going to think i &apos;m not working hard . &quot;
they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
so some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play .
lunch is like the recess for work .
i have my clients . i am doing my work like i always did .
let me tell you some about my life .
i said , i also have a pottery .
i became art director of the china and glass industry , and eventually under stalin &apos;s purges -- at the beginning of stalin &apos;s purges , i didn &apos;t know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested .
you &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad .
it &apos;s the only copy i had . pieces of it .
it also changed our lives in many unexpected ways , and those unexpected ways we later reflected on , that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us , and a year later , we launched babble , a website for parents .
we really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way .
we have charted our love for our child over time .
i felt incredibly connected to the community around me .
so it was a very difficult time .
rg : and that &apos;s when it &apos;s great to be running a website for parents , because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies .
in fact , when we first went out to raise money to start babble , the venture capitalists said , &quot; we categorically don &apos;t invest in companies founded by husbands and wives , because there &apos;s an extra point of failure .
and it turns out the further back you go in history , the little rougher it sounds .
and the one in mono , by the way , he used the pedal , and as he got older , he said , &quot; no , no , wait a minute .
and when you put on headphones , and you listen to this , you &apos;re inside of glenn gould &apos;s body .
i want to hear the pieces that horowitz didn &apos;t play .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you , we have this lab where we build and measure everything , back in raleigh , north carolina , and we flew out to los angeles .
what i &apos;m going to try and do is to give some pointers to what i think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis , what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis .
there will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year , thousands losing their jobs everyday in america .
some , i think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing .
people come together to sing about the things that really bug them .
even fidel castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism .
now that we see these huge differences in savings rates , how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences ?
is this difference in languages only between very , very distantly related languages , like english and chinese ?
what is the average difference here ?
it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe .
i get that all the time in dubai .
but nevertheless , i was recruited by the british council , along with about 25 other teachers .
maybe the barrier would be too universal .
now it &apos;s exploded .
and she was the best in the class at those subjects .
and he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that .
which i &apos;d never , really -- they had never , really , thought about but , now , they think about it .
as the sky gets darker , and the outside air temperatures drop below minus 100 degrees fahrenheit , the most environmentally hostile segment of helios &apos;s journey has gone by without notice , except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors .
tm : oh , 10 , 11 .
our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion , to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty . &quot;
he said , &quot; well what are you doing ? &quot;
and they &apos;re maggoting happily in the dog &apos;s hindquarters there .
and , until you have real compassion , you cannot recognize love . &quot;
but they are nice to somebody . i could be them . &quot;
and you think of him as nursing you .
how boring to run around chasing you .
and in buddhism , they catch it in the future life .
all of you know about the topic that i &apos;m supposed to talk about .
or there may be another way of doing it , which is to think about the problem in terms of what -- if you associate with moral philosophers -- is called the teapot problem .
one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation .
all right , so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind .
so , since the transistor is so simple , you can put lots of them together .
so there has to be function , the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low .
that is to say , if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work , it will be applicable to a very , very large variety of human conditions , and hence , extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions .
all right . well , thank you so much for your talk . thank you .
expand the pipeline down to the consumers .
they &apos;ve got so much sunk in it that it &apos;s very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets . emerging new markets , then , are the breeding grounds for passionate users .
over here , let &apos;s imagine we &apos;ve got wikipedia , linux , and beyond -- open source .
that &apos;s not their role ; they &apos;re supposed to read what we write .
he runs a company called shanda , which is the largest computer games company in china .
or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs to , in some sense , be co-producers of health .
and what happened was i was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio .
in the end , it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services .
sometimes they &apos;re very , very simple things .
we don &apos;t have time to play much of it .
so one of them was fairly straightforward .
and she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety .
it &apos;s blind experiments . they also gave me normal people and everything .
and it does have some consequences .
and that book is very interesting . because it &apos;s about witch trials , and how people thought back then .
what we do is we accelerate protons -- so , hydrogen nuclei -- around 99.999999 percent the speed of light .
now you might say , &quot; well , ok , but why not just look at it ?
one of the wonderful things , actually , i find , is that we &apos;ve discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
but there &apos;s an extra symbol in this equation : h .
if it &apos;s not true -- because it &apos;s quite a convoluted mechanism , although it &apos;s the simplest we &apos;ve been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the higgs particles we know have to turn up at the lhc .
it began to expand about a million , billion , billion , billion billionth of a second -- i think i got that right -- after the big bang .
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
how many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day ?
and if that &apos;s not enough , smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others .
big noise raised up : &quot; what is this ? what is happening ?
we planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets .
barack obama won — — because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera -- the trilogy emergency response application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
you can find out about places of worship .
we need people in our organizations who know what it &apos;s like to work with big data .
the self as we once knew it no longer exists , and i think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and i want to talk to you about what i think that means .
what happens when time warps ?
at all times , i can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you , while i sustain the illusion that i &apos;m tapped into you in real time .
at such moments , our selves are complete .
as chris said , i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation -- in the &apos; 80s -- of students who were protesting a military dictatorship , which has finally ended .
i said , &quot; english , mum . &quot;
dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you .
it didn &apos;t seem like a lot , for this guy who &apos;d seen so much , and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience , still found it in himself to try to protect me .
there were some really bad people there .
it doesn &apos;t require a tremendous thing .
and i want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture .
and if it is -- and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction .
so about 10,000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes .
three different options .
and by the way , as you do this , you can image it in two colors , which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer .
i don &apos;t have a good answer .
so these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles .
so one of the advantages of this design is , when you scale things down , the robot naturally becomes agile .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity .
and here you &apos;ll see daniel throw this hoop into the air , while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop .
plus the robots have to base their actions only on local information , what they sense from their neighbors .
so all these experiments you &apos;ve seen thus far , all these demonstrations , have been done with the help of motion capture systems .
but we &apos;re in southern california , close to los angeles , so i have to conclude with something focused on entertainment .
that &apos;s where i call home . i have a beehive in the backyard .
so the problems of bees today isn &apos;t necessarily something new . it has been happening since over a thousand years ago , but what we don &apos;t really notice are these problems in cities .
so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier .
i mean , locally in boston , there is a terrific company called green city growers , and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with q-tips , and if they miss that three day window , there &apos;s no fruit .
and i think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form .
well i think it has a lot to do with our history .
this tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world .
and that &apos;s not only true in this country , it is true all over the world .
i would love to go back to tuscany to this kind of traditional setting , gastronomy , good food .
we need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we &apos;ve had .
and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale .
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .
we &apos;ve never had that before .
it &apos;s the person that &apos;s sliding his hands up and down the levers , so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
amos winter : and thank you very much for having me today .
and it brought me straight into the conservation fray .
and they did this incredible ritual combat dance .
it is an animal which has been on the earth for just about 100 million years .
the chambal , if you look at it , has clear water .
so , we &apos;re not sure where this story is going to end , whether it &apos;s got a happy or sad ending .
do you have those conversations with people ?
and so , really , so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet .
we also found that the more people change , the better they got .
and the pain is not the problem : it &apos;s the symptom .
these are not election returns ; these are the percentage of people who are overweight .
and these are predominantly what are called the omega-3 fatty acids .
we took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer and who had elected , for reasons unrelated to the study , not to have surgery .
it was a randomized control study published in the lancet .
i &apos;m sorry .
now , fincher is an interesting guy .
i &apos;ll roll that for you now . this was the first test for benjamin button .
so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do .
and he came up with this idea of facial action coding system , or facs .
we brought in rick baker , and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry .
but now we needed to get brad &apos;s performance to drive our virtual benjamin .
so the key here was to keep everybody looking in ben &apos;s eyes .
but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology &quot; emotion capture , &quot; as opposed to just motion capture .
these guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities .
they only had islamic education , very little of it .
and they brought quite a bit of this stuff .
and they said , &quot; yeah , yeah , we &apos;ll walk . we &apos;ll find some camels . &quot;
it is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut .
like a lot of predators , they walk on their toes .
out !
the perfect desert machine .
yet my large , soft feet allow me to navigate sand .
and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them .
but i like to pretend that it comes with ease .
no wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
while we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich , they are looking down through the glass-bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity .
thanks .
the principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict , so you need to do something about it .
you can see that they work together , they pull at the same moment .
so it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
and that &apos;s more limited .
now we did a very simple experiment .
and especially if the partner draws attention to itself , they choose more .
then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
and i thank you for your attention .
so , over the next minute , you &apos;ll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in .
as i mentioned last year , i grew up with no religion at all .
so i think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
and i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over .
is that -- and it &apos;s actually been a theme of tedmed -- that joy is so important to your health , that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there &apos;s some sense of pleasure and joy in them .
so we did an experiment .
i could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
the brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula , a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion .
for the bargain price of a few thousand dollars , there are clinics in the u.s. that will give you one of these spect scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems .
well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them .
so how big do you think that is ?
and to make matters even worse , most of the text that we have are extremely short .
most of you said u , which is right .
now what about the indus script ?
if it does represent language , then how do we read the symbols ?
so we have no way of validating these particular readings , but if more and more of these readings start making sense , and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct , then we know that we are on the right track .
and this is the space probe cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of saturn .
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact dialed into the heavens .
a mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research .
he made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected .
luckily , they say -- i still am not sure -- but luckily , they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature , they say , &quot; oh who would really want to be compassionate ?
you know , the big communist revolutions , russia and china and so forth .
he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings .
there is a story about olof palme , the swedish prime minister , going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s .
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .
take the financial crisis .
last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death : &quot; don &apos;t worry . the united nations are coming . &quot;
you have to go to the literature and look up what &apos;s known about feet .
and in fact , the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot .
so , if we want to then , to our blueprint , add the first important feature , we want to add distributed foot contact .
now crabs don &apos;t miss footholds , because they normally move on sand -- until they come to our lab .
it &apos;s extraordinary how fast it can do it -- but if you slow it down , you see something that &apos;s quite extraordinary .
this is when its foot &apos;s in the air .
and they don &apos;t stick by glue , or they don &apos;t work like velcro , or they don &apos;t work with suction .
you have the audio ? you can hear it go up .
and third , we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology , and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make -- potentially -- something better than nature .
this is a calf in captivity making an imitation if you hummed this tune to your dog or cat and it hummed it back to you , you ought to be pretty surprised .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up-sweep , like &quot; woop , woop , woop . &quot;
to me , the most mind-bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern indian ocean , deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound .
this means that humpback song is a form of animal culture , just like music for humans would be .
let &apos;s now switch and think about a potential for human impacts .
susan parks of penn state has actually studied this .
the first case comes from the bay of fundy .
thank you very much .
and in telling stories , each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way .
educator roy gould and researcher curtis wong show a sneak preview of microsoft &apos;s worldwide telescope , which compiles images from telescopes and satellites to build a comprehensive , interactive view of our universe .
it turns out , from earliest childhood , boys , and then men , prefer the company of guys -- physical company .
no offense to banana slug owners . thank you .
here &apos;s an example of another kind of app . i can make these little fuzz balls .
firstly , because i &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to say it .
then we were victims of don porfirio .
but , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
two years ago , in galena city , chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , eric le barón .
when we thought masiosare was the strange enemy , and we sang , with a childlike heart , &quot; a soldier in each son . &quot;
i started juggling a long time ago , but long before that , i was a golfer , and that &apos;s what i was , a golfer .
so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm , with the obvious reference to the feet , but it &apos;s also time -- where the feet were , where the balls were .
ok ? and whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely , right ?
ok , you can do that ? yeah ? ok .
but i want you to do is also , with your eyes , is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow .
so , a moment , how would you define a moment ?
i always drove motorcycles . and when i bought my first car , it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents &apos; house . interesting .
now , what i just did was i worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference .
and to change , and to change .
interestingly enough , we used to primarily build 3-d models -- you know , you &apos;ve seen some today -- and 3-d renderings .
about a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum -- this is a new wing of the science museum in london , and it &apos;s primarily about digital and biomedical issues .
the first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos .
( the spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera .
designers are more trusted and more integrated into the business strategy of companies , and i have to say , for one , i feel very lucky at the progress that design has made since the first ted . thanks a lot .
a few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him , had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph .
but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s much easier if it &apos;s not really there .
but well done , him .
and i &apos;ve come to the conclusion -- because you &apos;ve asked this other question , &quot; what &apos;s another thing you can &apos;t see ? &quot;
now of course , if there &apos;s a scale for how awesome that is , that has to rank extremely , extremely high .
jm : now of course , we were thinking , well let &apos;s just first put the data out there for people to do science to it .
and he &apos;d tell you , &quot; well most people say thrived , but some people say throve . &quot;
and the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record , with a little twist , because now we &apos;ve got these nice charts .
we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing .
the great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it .
it &apos;s a sizable chunk of human culture .
now that &apos;s something i fall short of on a daily basis .
and that means it &apos;s harder for us to pay attention to the quiet , the subtle , the understated .
one , two , three . one , two , three . one , two , three .
now i don &apos;t know how to do that , but this is ted , and i think the ted community is capable of anything .
and then twitter came along , and made things even more magic , because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere .
she &apos;s an artist . he &apos;s a financial blogger for reuters , and they &apos;re pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath , and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that .
and the goal was 100,000 dollars .
celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance , but the internet and the content that we &apos;re freely able to share on it are taking us back .
this is inside out .
north dakota . standing rock nation , in this turtle island , &#91; unclear name &#93; from the dakota lakota tribe wanted to show that the native americans are still here .
they were all holding their photo as a statement .
i really didn &apos;t want to do any of these products and very early in my career i decided i was not going to be in the computer industry .
and they said , oh no , you can &apos;t study theory about brains .
this is normal science .
and it &apos;s also , although the brain looks very complicated , things look complicated until you understand them .
my daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten .
real intelligence is built on something else .
and it doesn &apos;t fit , so it gets all wrinkly . now look at how i &apos;ve drawn this here .
and when you go home tonight , you &apos;re going to put your hand out there , and you &apos;re going to reach for the doorknob and you &apos;re going to notice it &apos;s in the wrong spot , and you &apos;ll go , whoa , something happened .
first of all , we have to have the right framework .
if you don &apos;t build it , you don &apos;t understand it . so , one more slide here .
jeff hawkins : how brain science will change computing
do you know the figure that the u.n. talks about for fulfilling the millennium development goals is 80 billion dollars ?
his holiness , in his robes , is my new action hero .
when she was planting those trees , i don &apos;t think most people understand that , at the same time , she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country .
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change .
look , the homes are full of machines .
how can we tell this woman that she ain &apos;t going to have a washing machine ?
population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
adam and eve one day in the garden of eden realize they are naked .
in fact , take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme .
now studies prior to ours have shown that people don &apos;t recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites , but they react to those composites in a positive manner .
the way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done , and certainly not the best way they can be done .
however , in the book , he also offers us a way out of that society , similar to the path that adam and eve had to follow to leave the garden .
i was like , &quot; okay , that &apos;s social skill . &quot;
so at the moment of conception , they &apos;re doing little butt exercises .
and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature , it &apos;s a new humanism , it &apos;s a new enchantment .
and the third insight is that we &apos;re not primarily self-contained individuals .
scientists at the university of minnesota did a study in which they could predict with 77 percent accuracy , at age 18 months , who was going to graduate from high school , based on who had good attachment with mom .
they couldn &apos;t tell you how they did it , but they could feel cold , they felt a coldness , and they were more often right than wrong .
i realized that , though carol had died , that core piece of her had not died at all , but had lived on very determinedly in my brain . &quot;
but that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
they &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
and therefore my challenge was to understand how can i get out the power from this pain .
a very supportive friend of mine , a well-wisher of mine , used to give me every month , 2,000 rupees for vegetables .
i &apos;m not asking you all to become mahatma gandhis or martin luther kings , or medha patkars , or something like that .
right ? it &apos;s a fun word to say , and i get to say it a lot .
when a guy who looks like that , in that hat , is the face of modernity , you have a problem .
there &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
some of my best friends are books .
if you love a word , it becomes real .
i mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
if we can find comets without a telescope , shouldn &apos;t we be able to find words ?
we can put in all the meanings .
fifteen years earlier , i was a science journalist who people just laughed at when i said , &quot; i really would like to start my own computer magazine . &quot;
and what was really most exciting -- and i think richard wurman discovered this at least 20 years before i did -- was that all this stuff is connected .
jeff bezos kindly remarked to me , &quot; chris , ted is a really great conference .
something happened in the early morning hours of may 2nd , 2000 , that had a profound effect on the way our society operates .
there &apos;s been a strong trend toward miniaturization , better sensitivity , so much so that , a few years ago , a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys .
then she posted her design to the web , and if you don &apos;t have time to build your own , you can buy one .
can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that , with a spoofer ?
imagine , for example , you &apos;re being tracked .
it &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
so this is a very early prototype .
and this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
the saying is that with climate , those who know the most are the most worried .
it &apos;s just as well , because it can stay where it is .
they &apos;re incredibly safe , weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it .
this includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit .
and you can power the entire u.s. vehicle fleet with 73,000 to 145,000 five-megawatt wind turbines .
this is from real data in california , looking at wind data and solar data .
so the other thing is , we don &apos;t need nuclear energy .
secondly , think about this .
i will also add one other thing .
fifteen percent of the entire u.s .
the analogy for me is alaska . you know , we bought alaska .
and that , my friend , is amazing motivation .
how much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit ?
probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this . it was literally impossible .
for a chance to win the first free ticket to space , look for specially marked packages of diet 7-up .
you know , innovators , the entrepreneurs out there , you know that when you &apos;re going for a goal , the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself .
nature &apos;s main process of creation , morphogenesis , is the splitting of one cell into two cells .
i designed the process that generated the form .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
there &apos;s that dip there for the 1918 flu .
so we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would , and say , &quot; how can we do better ? &quot;
well that was exciting , but would it actually work in a real human being ?
we have many discussions now between nih and companies about doing this that are looking very promising .
we are in a remarkable moment here .
she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care .
i &apos;m not sure of how many of you in washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and , the more recent , museum of islamic art opened in qatar in 2008 .
instead , she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture , nation and heritage .
and this is one of our filmmakers &apos; products .
&quot; know thyself , &quot; that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization that we are traveling .
my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry .
and so they did .
and then he said , &quot; but i don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; so i said , &quot; ok . &quot;
and how i constructed it , is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead .
right . as you can see , bart simpson is having a little argument .
i experimented with a -- i found a dead fly .
i would say it probably measures ...
it must be a machine . &quot;
as you can see , he &apos;s looking at the moment . he &apos;s got a little grimace on his face .
that is all well and good , but where do we go wrong , and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world ?
all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way .
this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image .
i traveled around the world , entered different cultures , wrote a series of books about my travels , including &quot; walking the bible . &quot;
&quot; they &apos;ll have loving families and welcoming homes , but they may not have me .
and the first one was no family , only friends .
i was like , &quot; yes ? &quot;
then he took my fibula from my calf , cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh , where it now lives .
instead , it was everybody running the other way .
someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads .
you go slow , you get where you &apos;re going , but you get there with this community you built along the way .
so i stand here today as you see now , walking without crutches or a cane .
and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe , you know , in his brain something was stirring , some sort of musical gift .
this is a photo of you , derek , playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops .
now the truly amazing thing was , with all those scales , derek , you could not only play &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; in the usual key , but any note i play , derek can play it on .
but in america , they &apos;ve coined this term , &quot; the human ipod &quot; for derek , which i think is just missing the point , really , because derek , you &apos;re so much more than an ipod .
and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture .
i do so many things on this little device .
and we want to learn other languages .
if she has a bad run , and her score isn &apos;t good , she &apos;ll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can &apos;t see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go .
they have very sophisticated cooperation .
were the people that we heard about yesterday , on the easter island , who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid ?
i feel this deep shame , and that &apos;s why in 1991 in tanzania , i started a program that &apos;s called roots and shoots .
as i travel around the world 300 days a year , everywhere there &apos;s a group of roots and shoots of different ages .
it &apos;s very encouraging .
thank you .
what that means is , i can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab , and these chemicals will start to self-associate to form larger and larger structures .
you add the droplet to the system .
so then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times , and one time something very interesting happened .
these are very dirty little protocells , as a matter of fact .
but that suggests the issue that i &apos;m trying to get at here , that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health .
and of course , these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic , the obesity epidemic , the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things .
then of course , it goes into the entrapment device .
what the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary , more insidious and more pervasive crisis , which is the crisis of agency , which is what to do .
here &apos;s who put them up and who are avid pencil users .
healthy sub-populations of birds , increasing biodiversity generally .
they &apos;re nutritionally appropriate , not like doritos .
what if , instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal , we started with what the tissues are made of , the basic unit of life , the cell ?
and what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets , and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another , like phyllo pastry , to form thicker sheets , which we then let mature .
it &apos;s clean , open and educational , and this is in contrast to the hidden , guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today .
and if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years , it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles .
it &apos;s produced to get sulfur out of gasoline -- which i find is somewhat ironic .
and the key to all of this is to make it affordable , to make it exciting , to get it on a pathway where there &apos;s a way to make money doing it .
she worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean &apos;s office , so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class , for whatever reason , who were waiting to be disciplined .
but then , they were very surprised when i graduated from high school .
and it was out of fear -- fear of , well , what if they get it wrong ?
i was born in 1944 in brazil , in the times that brazil was not yet a market economy .
when i made love with my wife , i had no sperm that came out of me ; i had blood .
we created an institution called instituto terra , and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere .
that is the essence of our life , these forests .
and i &apos;ll show you the last picture .
i &apos;d go to times square and i &apos;d look at the amazing ladies on the wall , and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them .
you can see the lispenard meadows draining down through here , through what is tribeca now , and the beaches that come up from the battery , all the way to 42nd st .
so , we built a model that explains where those fields might have been .
and you can look at what a wet meadow needs .
we used the tools they use in hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies .
and i think this is what we &apos;re learning about building cities in the future .
the second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways . right ?
well , worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future .
you can start doing things like , you know , transit systems that actually work to transport people , in effective and reasonably comfortable manners .
i encourage you to look on worldchanging if you &apos;re into it .
the second thing is tools for collaboration , be they systems of collaboration , or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration . right ?
and i would personally say that we have to craft new political realities , not only in places like india , afghanistan , kenya , pakistan , what have you , but here at home as well .
you get grassroots solutions , things that work for people who have no capital or limited access .
and we have new tools .
they liked to draw the little mermaid , they &apos;d like to draw a smurf , they &apos;d like to draw micky mouse .
which meant that if you fielded average content , you got a third of the u.s. public for free -- tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn &apos;t too terrible .
it took them a while to formulate plan b .
so what pipa and sopa risk doing is taking a centuries-old legal concept , innocent until proven guilty , and reversing it -- guilty until proven innocent .
because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving that , that turns out to be really inconvenient .
and then i thought out of curiosity i &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
i said , &quot; no . &quot;
and we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal .
but then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it .
food , if you come to the barefoot college , is solar cooked .
she looks after 20 goats in the morning , but she &apos;s prime minister in the evening .
men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate .
and they haven &apos;t collapsed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with .
we &apos;re going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom .
well , it turns out when brains triple in size , they don &apos;t just get three times bigger ; they gain new structures .
the research that my laboratory has been doing , that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing , have revealed something really quite startling to us , something we call the &quot; impact bias , &quot; which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly .
he lost his money ; he lost his power .
second : spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can .
what happens ? watch as happiness is synthesized .
&quot; no problem , jim . all i want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least . &quot;
&quot; free ? aren &apos;t you just giving me my own paper ? &quot;
the other half of the students are told exactly the opposite : &quot; make your choice . and by the way , the mail is going out , gosh , in two minutes , to england .
is there really nothing good or bad ?
they rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe watching the spectacle .
some people watch this event because of a nascar-like fascination with things bumping and grinding . burning the parachute as it fell -- that was last weekend .
&quot; what &apos;s the matter ? the pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you ? &quot;
there &apos;s stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine .
any vehicular outing with that woman from the time i was a young child , guys , naturally included flashing , blue lights .
somebody &apos;s storytelling . interactive art . you can talk to me .
only a couple of women are going uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . right .
so , i say , &apos; perdon , yo no hablo ingles . &apos; well , wouldn &apos;t you know , he had been in honduras for the peace corps . &quot;
&quot; no , no , no . the only thing with him is , he &apos;s an idiot .
of course , her comeback is , &quot; when have i embarrassed you ? &quot;
don &apos;t you want to look ?
&quot; i &apos;m not going anywhere . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , i follow little old women around parking lots to see if they &apos;ll stop . yes , it &apos;s my mother ! &quot;
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
it &apos;s because they said , &quot; it &apos;s eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day .
so , the last example of this is congestion pricing , very famously done in london .
there is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide , respond to emergencies , get traffic moving , provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce co2 emissions in every sector .
there isn &apos;t anybody in washington lobbying to make it happen -- or in those municipalities , to build out their cities with these wireless networks -- because there &apos;s zero ongoing communications cost .
imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero .
i went to high school .
and it was a really heavy time .
i &apos;d love to just talk about each one briefly .
there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air , or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said , &quot; found money . &quot;
for the closing thought , i want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to canada .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; i &apos;m five . i don &apos;t even know where i am .
and that moment is right now , and those moments are counting down , and those moments are always , always , always fleeting .
unlike the grand canyon or the washington monument , people come here to see what &apos;s no longer there .
and we were asked to participate in a few projects before this .
we saw how ps 234 worked .
and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in new york , because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible .
the next day i got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding .
so the notion of collaboration -- i think this reinforces how important that is .
dr : right . and we &apos;re looking for other things .
sorry , ted .
a heavy weight boxer punches you straight in the face -- 58 gs .
and here &apos;s the really alarming part : we don &apos;t fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries .
we &apos;ve just rolled this out in the last couple months -- co kids with brain injury .
so i just want to tell you my story .
and i &apos;m not comfortable with that .
on the contrary , doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high .
in 2002 , they were facing a different battle .
there &apos;s something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away .
the company , gilead , that holds the patents , has licensed the intellectual property to the medicines patent pool .
what about beijing ?
and how do we do that ?
and , over time , we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about , because that is something that &apos;s happening not just in one street corner in mumbai .
out comes this , a little lunch box -- form factor .
basically this is a micro-controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world , and that &apos;s what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else .
and then i realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby .
so we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters .
was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person ?
there &apos;s emotional contagion that takes place in human populations .
why do they not look like this ?
now , you would rather be c .
now , the reason , i think , that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism .
because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species , the majority of babies born in the developed world are having the opportunity to grow old .
years ago , my colleagues and i embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period .
we &apos;ve said , could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions , and so you switch to the positive emotions ?
the numbers won &apos;t determine the outcome .
dance has never had a better friend than technology .
so , it was always like , they called me kid david , because i was the kid .
and if we look at our lives , we have indeed taken the best part of the meat .
it began carrying , among other things , a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo , eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the sioux .
the american dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left .
1900 : the u.s. indian population reached its low point -- less than 250,000 , compared to an estimated eight million in 1492 .
they &apos;re killing themselves while we watch them die . &quot;
aaron huey : america &apos;s native prisoners of war
that &apos;s actually not true .
it &apos;s not just medicine .
now , diarrhea &apos;s interesting because it &apos;s been around for thousands of years , ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water .
i &apos;m going to give you a little math problem , and i want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible .
ready ? black .
so now , while you &apos;re thinking about that let &apos;s move to a second task .
you can be safe because when you &apos;re hit , you survive , or you can be safe because you avoid accidents .
anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence , just as a result of this .
we put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies .
it &apos;s kind of the model that has worked in other contexts .
but if any of you have studied electrical engineering , we can also create a short circuit .
and it &apos;s been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone .
when the magazine -- actually , when i got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages .
my favorite topic is shortcuts .
so , that was the warming up .
with queens and -- it &apos;s ok -- queens and tens .
right ? you agree .
direct in the right brain , that &apos;s much better . and so -- -- arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing .
and then , i will demonstrate a thing from russian satellite , stealen -- stolen , probably copied from america but we will see .
three , four , five , six . then i calculate -- yeah , good .
lg : very good .
yeah .
i liked it . now , a little more difficult .
yeah ? ok .
so here , diamonds , hearts -- no , diamonds . good , good .
looks good , like batman . ow !
three -- three of diamonds . yes !
seven .
touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
you can see it by looking at my head .
that &apos;s the first group ; it &apos;s quite a small group .
so i &apos;m not going to go on until every single person in this room , downstairs and in aspen , and everybody else looking , will come to love and understand classical music .
let &apos;s try it again . ooh , the ted choir .
it &apos;s the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day , turns off the key in his car and says , &quot; aah , i &apos;m home . &quot; because we all know where home is .
think of it . 1,600 people , busy people , involved in all sorts of different things , listening , understanding and being moved by a piece by chopin .
i realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people .
now , can we do that ? no . and we &apos;ll make ourselves wrong and others wrong . but it is a possibility to live into . thank you .
i bring you into a room . i give you a candle , some thumbtacks and some matches .
that &apos;s not how it &apos;s supposed to work . right ?
what happened this time ?
now , i mean it makes me crazy .
is this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here ?
management is great .
in a rowe people don &apos;t have schedules .
this is the thrilla &apos; in manila .
but in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere , it can stand up on one point .
and so this is the size of the sun .
then i had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres .
this is the control room inside of the ship .
it would also be able to be an open code , so people could interact with it .
it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming .
but we don &apos;t like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity .
so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors , and people had patience .
there are a lot of problems with this question .
now which pie would we prefer , and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer ?
or rather a cubicle , an open-space cubicle , with a lot of space .
so that &apos;s a sort of a tradition .
riccardo muti , please .
&quot; why ? because you don &apos;t let us develop .
did you see this kind of movement ? let me conduct you . twice .
what do you think karajan &apos;s reply was ? when should i start ?
but here and there and that . you know what to do .
now something else .
well he had a wonderful expression , but only one .
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model , and moderating what comes in at one end , and moderating the outputs at the other end .
but the thing that i notice , as i talk to climate scientists , is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes , as the data that &apos;s coming in , which is far ahead of what the ipcc are talking about .
and as we sit , exchanging free ideas with each other , there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers , extracting the minerals to make all of those things .
when they encounter shock from the outside that they don &apos;t just unravel and fall to pieces .
some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects , like community-supported agriculture schemes , urban food production , creating local food directories , and so on .
because i think stories are vital here .
but we &apos;re spending 36 percent .
what were those things that allowed us to hide this ?
well what &apos;s going to give ?
just look at this spending .
but in fact , their work was sort of pushed off .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mcat and applying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr. gupta .
now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
jinsop lee : hey , my name &apos;s jinsop , and today , i &apos;m going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses . hey !
here &apos;s chris &apos; clock .
however , it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste .
perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear , and because they practice such art all day long , people honestly get a little tired around kids .
the eros between sentences , that is the essence of flaubert &apos;s novel . &quot;
they aren &apos;t told by their boss or anyone , they just do it .
kids have to go to lessons , to school , do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons , but they aren &apos;t fun anymore .
most of the works have no title , untitled .
sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with legos or putting together plastic robots .
students at first wonder whether they can actually do it , but later they have so much fun . i rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play .
when we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art , enemies appear on the outside .
someone is a golfer by day and writer by night .
the right answer , confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft , was that venus was very hot -- 900 degrees fahrenheit .
but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
and the land , to depths of tens of meters , is also warming .
so co2 , methane , and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge , even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .
fifty years ago , such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area .
if we start next year , it is six percent per year .
what safety they had was very scant .
which i &apos;m sure you wouldn &apos;t want .
you should hear some of the phone conversations that i have with people on my bluetooth in the shop .
not the cardboard box , but the green screen .
they first dropped some dummies .
not even a jet engine .
well there &apos;s a little bit more to it than that .
this is the communication headset you &apos;ll see on lots of space suits .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
you may have seen it : &quot; nativity ii . &quot; but james got the part of joseph , which we were thrilled about .
you don &apos;t think of shakespeare having a father , do you ?
we all have bodies , don &apos;t we ? did i miss a meeting ?
if you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance .
if my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often , thankfully .
if all human beings disappeared from the earth , within 50 years all forms of life would flourish . &quot;
now , the american head of programming wanted new local arabic comedy .
this is all true .
so clearly , from the inside , we are doing our best to change our image , and it &apos;s exploding .
when i was a student , the mortality rate was about 95 percent .
why are they number one here ?
it &apos;s a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like huntington &apos;s or parkinson &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s disease where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex .
i &apos;m standing in front of you today in all humility , wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education .
our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums , a second story building , the only second story building inside the slums .
shukla bose : well , that girl that you saw , her father sells flowers on the roadside .
ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics .
my accent with english improved a lot .
we do not believe in scale because we believe in quality , and scale and numbers will automatically happen .
educating the poor is more than just a numbers game , says shukla bose . she tells the story of her groundbreaking parikrma humanity foundation , which brings hope to india &apos;s slums by looking past the daunting statistics and focusing on treating each child as an individual .
howard is not so easily placated .
now in the industry -- i don &apos;t know whether you care about this , or how much time i have to go into this .
and prego turned to howard , and they said , &quot; you telling me that one third of americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs ? &quot; and he said yes !
so that &apos;s number one thing that howard did .
there are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people .
what is the great revolution in science of the last 10 , 15 years ?
one of my favorites is called subclinical acne .
and that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk , which we &apos;ll see if that happens for everyone , you will be a pre-vivor .
because what we &apos;ve created is a sort of field of dreams , when it comes to medical technology .
so , dad graduated harvard in 1946 , married my mom , and bought a house in lexington , massachusetts , where the first shots were fired against the british in 1775 , although we didn &apos;t actually hit any of them until concord .
so did j.c.r. licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction .
actually , it was just me embracing my nature , which means that i didn &apos;t actually fall that far from the tree after all .
this was even before the web .
i &apos;m going to show you a couple now .
and when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique .
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
survey after survey , from pew research to the annenberg center for public policy , has found that daily show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows .
there are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline .
not for god , not for country , not for profit -- just as a basic metric for global decision-making .
and the professional , historical linguists in the u.s .
so it may be good for the waistline , but it probably won &apos;t keep you satiated for very long .
and in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago , and they &apos;re pretty modern , just 50 million years ago , so -- so interestingly , they give away their ancestry as they develop .
and it &apos;s pictured right here , that little tag up there .
and under those kelps -- this is why the molas come there because it &apos;s spa time for the molas there .
now that &apos;s important , though , because if there &apos;s a lot of fishing pressure , that population doesn &apos;t get replenished .
in 1962 , buckminster fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope .
now this piece is currently in process -- due out in may -- but what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve put together a small demo , just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere .
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
so , he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice .
have we stopped seeing injustice ?
and i thought , &quot; this is what we need , as a language . &quot;
listen , go fetch that cotton sari you have .
how could it be otherwise ?
look what they &apos;ve done .
her father the king said , &quot; who will marry a whistling princess ? &quot;
at tedindia , mallika sarabhai , a dancer / actor / politician , tells a transformative story in dance -- and argues that the arts may be the most powerful way to effect change , whether political , social or personal .
and 1945 , after the war , the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine .
oppenheimer , who had built the bomb .
the &quot; graph &apos;g-beam turn on . &quot; this next slide , that &apos;s the -- as far as i know -- the first digital bitmap display , 1954 .
&quot; everything up to this point is wasted time . &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the use ? good night . &quot;
&quot; parting thought : when there &apos;s bigger and better errors , we &apos;ll have them . &quot;
this is some of the generations of his universe .
do you want to let it loose on the internet ?
we have an awful , awful reality right now .
mexico , australia , germany , india , china , all have massive problems of obesity and bad health .
she &apos;s the third generation of americans that hasn &apos;t grown up within a food environment where they &apos;ve been taught to cook at home or in school , or her mom , or her mom &apos;s mom .
can &apos;t even get them out the door -- and i &apos;m being serious -- can &apos;t even get them there . forklift .
that ain &apos;t happening anymore .
i need to say one thing , and it &apos;s so important in hopefully the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months .
do you know what that is ?
okay ? there &apos;s sugar in everything .
they need to help us shop . they need to show us how to cook quick , tasty , seasonal meals for people that are busy .
let &apos;s go back to the home .
it &apos;s incredibly important .
&quot; what do we do now ?
these were the various things that i was looking at as i was trying to understand it .
cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details , to exchange information about new malware that was out there .
he was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life .
max vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of santa clara , california in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the fbi .
and let me be blunt about this .
it &apos;s increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency .
so as a result of that , demographers predict that through 2025 , 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them .
it &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over the strip across the street .
i think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction .
we need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
we need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened .
the final challenge is for all of you .
ok , at first women were a little shy , a little reluctant to talk .
i think before i did the &quot; vagina monologues &quot; i didn &apos;t really believe in happiness .
and i actually saw and met women who had been flogged by being caught eating vanilla ice cream .
and she came , and she witnessed this , and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband , and that she would bring v-day to guatemala .
now , mr. alligator never did come , but the idea of mr. alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it ok for me to keep going because i believed , in the distance , there would be someone coming to rescue me .
so , &quot; yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
it was a brutal beating . and midway through that brutality , one of mr. teszler &apos;s sons , andrew , looked up and said , &quot; is it time to take the capsule now , papa ? &quot;
mr. teszler said , &quot; you are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business . do you have any other questions ? &quot;
&quot; yo napot , sandor ! &quot;
as it does , i suspect , that of everybody here .
but as i began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions , i found there was a kind of a missing component , for everywhere i came across descriptions of tapestries .
and in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and actresses , or living sculptures .
in that moment , our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal , but if we &apos;re doing our job right , and you &apos;ve checked the jargon at the front door , trust your instinct .
would you explain the rules for admission ?
pm : you &apos;re running a medical clinic .
and to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war -- when i was 16 , and my sister was 11 , when the civil war broke out .
h thank you .
in today &apos;s context , it was a bunch of crap , but it was the law of geology , vertical tectonics .
and we almost sank the ship , but i became enraptured with mounting expeditions . and over the last 49 years , i &apos;ve done about 120 , 121 -- i keep doing them -- expeditions .
running along this entire 42,000 miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes .
this is what a real one looks like , on the juan de fuca ridge .
they shouldn &apos;t be there . and we called it lost city .
we &apos;ve been discovering these along ancient trade routes , where they &apos;re not supposed to be .
the way we &apos;re going to run this -- we have no idea what we &apos;re going to discover .
and when we have the best middle schools in the world , we &apos;ll have the best kids pumped out of that system , let me tell you .
but even in parts of the world like the united states where education is available , it might not be within reach .
we get unbelievable segregation .
these are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon .
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture .
so we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised , where tens of thousands of students are grading each other &apos;s work , and quite successfully , i have to say .
now , if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer , you would never notice .
i think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on .
for those of you who i &apos;ll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards , you could please refrain from saying , &quot; oh my god , you &apos;re so much shorter in real life . &quot;
or this ad that i read in the new york times : &quot; wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society .
and that &apos;s why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head .
that &apos;s how you assert yourself .
until you read , as i did , an ad in the los angeles times .
but the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you &apos;re going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world .
well , look at michael hawley , or look at dean kamen , or look at my grandmother .
i just wanted to put the scientists in their place .
it literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition , it &apos;s literally re-cognition , rewiring how you think -- i had a joke to go with this and i forgot it .
i like to think of what i do as a probability wave .
we live in an incredible age of modern medicine .
although every time i go to pompeii , i &apos;m amazed that they had the equivalent of a mcdonald &apos;s on every street corner , too .
there &apos;s really a tree like that out there . that &apos;s really what it comes to .
but , all around the world , in japan , in canada , there &apos;s talk about this , of reviving this in the united states .
sp : so , what can we do about this ? oh , by the way , we &apos;re overdue .
this is rocket science , but it &apos;s not hard rocket science .
we have a real , major outbreak of disease in the united states , we are not prepared to cope with it .
astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years .
comets are a tougher act .
thank you .
they define what the system is .
now a layer in , the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting , partly as a function of temperature , partly as a function of all the other factors , and you &apos;ve got a really complicated system .
and it wasn &apos;t easy . it wasn &apos;t easy in those days .
you can see the copper tips on these things .
here &apos;s what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point .
just as you move , it generates power .
they eject it to the surface where it floats , and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane , and it &apos;s brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption .
we can think them out . we can create incredible things .
and yet it is in times like this that i think architecture can thrive with big ideas , ideas that are not small . think of the great cities .
it &apos;s actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way .
so again , the notion that a building should just be explicit i think is a false notion , which has reduced architecture into banality .
and we live in a world which is connecting us more and more .
and yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them .
it &apos;s an art of communication .
and there of course is the space that we need to breathe , is the space we need to dream .
and yet , compromise , consensus , that is what i believe in .
in fact , even if producing co2 was good for the environment , given that we &apos;re going to run out of hydrocarbons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating .
that was the good news . the bad news was that to do it , he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops .
so if you start a trip at 9 a.m. , by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat , hit the restroom , coffee , and keep going .
it works for decades . it &apos;ll work for probably a century .
so i think it &apos;s actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses .
so you &apos;ve somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by 75 percent , depending on how you calculate it .
you asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward.em : certain cruises are apparently highly problematic .
is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce ?
i think it will be quite a challenge for me .
but then , he said , &quot; if you see a leopard , boy , you better run like hell . &quot;
and my father said , &quot; why don &apos;t you just go to school ? &quot;
we learned these things from outsiders .
but today , there are more than 130 lions .
so , come and talk to me about namibia , and better yet , come to namibia and see for yourself how we have done it .
you &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here -- comes from sustainable stocks .
we must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
it doesn &apos;t work .
it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
well for health , i &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
ice is the canary in the global coal mine .
i spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally .
in the past hundred years , the temperature of the earth has gone up 1.3 degrees fahrenheit , .75 degrees celsius , and it &apos;s going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere .
now we turn on our time lapse .
that &apos;s where it started .
or if you take an american reference , to the u.s. capitol building and you pack 3,000 capitol buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
the more polite ones said , &quot; well , you know , indians make good software programmers and accountants , but they can &apos;t do the creative stuff . &quot;
so within the company , there &apos;s no difference in the forward citation rates of their indian subsidiaries versus their u.s. subsidiaries .
this demographic dividend is incredible , but paradoxically , there &apos;s also the mirage of mighty labor pools .
coppola &apos;s script describes these guys as , &quot; exhausted in shirt sleeves .
but he didn &apos;t die on dench &apos;s birthday .
would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
and they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer .
and this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells , two cancer cells become four cancer cells , and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth .
gbm affects about 10,000 people in the u.s. each year .
a year after this treatment -- in fact , this is his baseline mri .
i &apos;m going to let him , in this very short clip , describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words .
there &apos;s now a new research project underway at the karolinska in sweden to prove that hypothesis .
it &apos;s called kunds ; somewhere it is called &#91; unclear &#93; .
and it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season .
the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it .
so , estate , public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body .
it squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand .
so , throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure .
so , first of all , i wish i had your eloquence , truly , in any language .
it doesn &apos;t matter if this is the jungles of singapore or the tundra of northern finland .
and they &apos;re investing in telecoms , shopping malls .
south africa is playing a role .
how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
boom ! india began to explode .
and then you and i can help make sure that for africa , the 21st century is their century .
and they are building what i call the spinternet .
this is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation , and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online .
now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page .
see this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man .
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family .
he was a troubled kid .
you only tell your dearest , closest friend , sworn to secrecy for life , the first time you had sex .
it was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
it &apos;s redolent of james bond movies and kipling ballads .
in order to have soft power , you have to be connected .
he &apos;s called an isthri wala . but he &apos;s carrying a 21st-century instrument .
and this is happening more and more .
it &apos;s a civilizational story to begin with .
but , the whole point is that india is the nationalism of an idea .
the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
and i was thinking that your body hated it , at the time , because we are very immune to this . this is called alpha-gal epitope .
and it &apos;s killing bacteria . it &apos;s eating them .
do you know of any car that didn &apos;t have a maker ? yes / no .
that &apos;s all there is to it .
our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens every time , every time you do this with adults .
don &apos;t know what they do with that , but they have one .
can you not figure out how to do it , or something ?
well , at least , we did once .
so , everybody ready ? ok ? off you go .
mckim published a paper in 1966 , describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity .
they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war , i think , and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .
the prototyping carts , filled with colored paper and play-doh and glue sticks and stuff -- i mean , they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .
some of it &apos;s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don &apos;t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid .
he wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter .
as designers , we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .
but then i stopped , because i figured , &quot; oh , you know , i made it .
he said , &quot; no . but it can buy prozac . &quot;
so here is to your continued success .
in my entire life i had seen in black and white , and suddenly everything was in shocking technicolor .
now i should say , before that , what i did is i posted a conductor track of myself conducting .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
i feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family .
there are a couple of these kinds of eco-dashboards right now -- so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently .
they want us to optimize ourselves to fit in .
so that &apos;s the fourth question i &apos;d like to leave you with : what vision of the good life do your designs convey ?
do we stop there ?
we were thrilled to have that kind of audience , and just a bit terrified that we hadn &apos;t finished preparing the class yet .
you can watch them any time you want .
we &apos;re gathering thousands of interactions per student per class , billions of interactions altogether , and now we can start analyzing that , and when we learn from that , do experimentations , that &apos;s when the real revolution will come .
and so the first question that came to mind was , well , how fast does this limb move ?
and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system . so our first surprise .
and then if you take a look at the video -- it &apos;s a little bit hard to see -- it &apos;s outlined in yellow .
and we were able to get some force measurements out .
sheila patek : and so if we just take that one frame , what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble .
and there &apos;s actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods .
so i have one message .
this is the envelope , and this is the gondola , the payload .
ok , this is good stuff .
we just learned so much in three hours in the water there .
so bob gelfond &apos;s around here -- but somebody in the audience here has license number 20 .
and the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels , eelgrass and oysters -- species that live in the harbor -- and , at the same time , harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now .
so we were inspired by the oyster , but i was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster .
and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .
and so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem .
something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood .
she was thrown in prison in tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country .
so i was going in , interviewing these people and doing their portraits .
this was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare-tipped darts .
and they &apos;re all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance .
united states came in second to last in geographic knowledge .
so there &apos;s a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here .
but you go and look to the center of the galaxy , it &apos;s thousands of years ago .
and it &apos;s maturing up to the present time .
and when you &apos;re in the middle of the galaxies it &apos;s hard to see the pattern ; it &apos;s like being in the middle of life .
notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern .
so here &apos;s that same end result .
and this is a simple one , because it doesn &apos;t have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it .
we want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non-linear effects that are starting to move , to modify , and are giving us a hint about how space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments .
i &apos;d also seen a few kung fu movies , and secretly i kind of thought i might be able to learn how to fly , but i was very young at the time .
we need an exercise . we need a framework to learn how to be more mindful .
it does hurt . and we reinforce the storyline , right ?
so i did . i went home , i grabbed a pencil , and i just started letting my hand shake and shake .
i took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas , and wondered what if , instead of painting on a canvas , i could only paint on my chest ?
and in return , i found a process of creating art that &apos;s perpetual and unencumbered by results .
they &apos;re called self-settlers .
wild boar , lynx , moose , they &apos;ve all returned to the region in force , the very real , very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans .
the power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative .
she sleeps with her cellphone , so do i .
so you want to go to that board meeting , but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you .
i was caught off guard when stephen colbert asked me a profound question , a profound question .
and we &apos;re vulnerable .
but here , connection is more like a symptom than a cure .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m calling for here , now : reflection and , more than that , a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us , what it might be costing us .
that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler .
and i knew how mr. webster defined it : as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige , or something of that sort -- worthy accomplishments perhaps , but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success .
then she came up and said , &quot; they ask me why i teach and i reply , &apos; where could i find such splendid company ? &apos; there sits a statesman , strong , unbiased , wise ; another daniel webster , silver-tongued .
i believe in time -- very important .
and they are . they want to change everything .
reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us .
i &apos;d want one to realize that defense usually wins championships , and would work hard on defense .
the fact is that we &apos;re living longer .
plus we have stem cells .
we then tease the cells apart , we grow the cells outside the body .
and there &apos;s a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through .
so while we &apos;ve been talking today , you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage .
i was able to wrestle in high school .
lm : most of my professors were all for it , and they said , &quot; bring pictures and show me the clips online , &quot; and &quot; i &apos;m happy for you . &quot;
lo and behold , there in reseda , ca was rondoron who wanted swap his or her &quot; like new &quot; copy of &quot; sex and the city &quot; for my copy of &quot; 24 . &quot;
and the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates .
from morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food , we are consuming and collaborating once again .
so i want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors .
i want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening .
i had never in my life ever tasted candy .
the man with no legs says , &quot; i can see as far as the end of the world , but i can &apos;t save myself from a cat , or whatever animals . &quot;
joseph lekuton , a member of parliament in kenya , starts with the story of his remarkable education , then offers a parable of how africa can grow . his message of hope has never been more relevant .
co : we walked up to the church because we heard that they had hot meals , but when we arrived we found problems .
mo : my boyscout troop would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes .
this leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers , thousands of donations , and all with no training and no tools .
if we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together , we can create new standards in disaster recovery .
we &apos;ve been able to see the same transformation in texas and in alabama .
and the estimate is that in 2050 , there &apos;ll be three billion squatters , better than one in three people on earth .
i thought they might be playing king of the hill , but i was wrong .
the crud in the front is mattress stuffing , and you see that all over turkey .
and what hotel means , in kenya and india , is an eating-place .
she lives in one of those tents on the highway median in mumbai .
there are 37 million totally blind people on our planet , but those of us who &apos;ve shared in the technological changes mainly come from north america , europe , japan and other developed parts of the world .
mrs. lois doery , whom i later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
i didn &apos;t have to be nice to people !
isn &apos;t that a great book ?
i wonder what the future will hold .
it will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .
biochemist gregory petsko makes a convincing argument that , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll see an epidemic of neurological diseases , such as alzheimer &apos;s , as the world population ages . his solution : more research into the brain and its functions .
in a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document , we have amazing new possibilities .
i &apos;m going to start worrying about those the day my computer becomes aware of my printer .
so the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward .
if we wanted to accelerate that process , we could do things like have our best economists and policymakers play &quot; jeopardy ! &quot; against watson .
suggesting that god expresses himself or herself through powerlessness , rather than power .
we want a god who can weep with those who weep , and rejoice with those who rejoice .
does god order each moment ? does the wind and the waves obey him ?
perhaps , but these ideas are all just variations on god controlling everything , the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign .
in the natural cycle of life and death , the creation and destruction that must happen continuously .
by seeking intimate connection with your inwardness .
so , technology was sort of absent from everybody &apos;s thinking until 1952 , which happened to be the year of my birth .
well , that &apos;s because they &apos;re all young .
so , climate change is not a new thing .
we actually don &apos;t know .
at the same time , it wants to give us things , and what it gives us is basically progress .
the response to a bad idea -- like , say , a tungsten light bulb -- is a better idea . ok ?
and it &apos;s moving through us , this self-organization , and we &apos;re extending and accelerating it , and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it .
and so we started talking about this .
you see , this is sort of a sketch i did on a napkin .
she took over as executive director .
they &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; a teacher will say , &quot; i need 12 tutors for the next five sundays .
and this became an ongoing thing . more and more books .
so , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
all the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
so you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-eleven would be .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
we only talk about one side of it .
oh , half a million women in rwanda get raped in 100 days .
in order for us to understand what actually peace means , we need to understand , as one sudanese woman once told me , &quot; peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again . &quot;
that mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do .
it &apos;s kind of a book about questions , questions about simplicity .
so , i thought complexity was attacking me suddenly , so i thought , &quot; ah , simplicity . very important . &quot;
it &apos;s very hard work to make tofu .
i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us .
this is a floral theme calendar in 1997 , and this is a firework calendar . so , you launch the number into space , because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks , you &apos;re cooler for some reason .
you can &apos;t type very much on this .
and each butter-fry is composed of different pieces .
because i want to simplify them for you .
you know , i have a lot of cocky freshmen at mit , so i tell them , &quot; oh , your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger , but in your late twenties and mid-thirties , cells , they die . &quot;
i &apos;m a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids , and tipper and i put 33 solar panels on our house , and dug the geothermal wells , and did all of that other stuff .
already , around the arctic circle -- this is a famous village in alaska . this is a town in newfoundland . antarctica . latest studies from nasa .
&apos;70s . &apos; 80s . &apos; 90s . we have to stop this . and the good news is that we can .
we now have a culture of distraction .
demand -- change the light bulbs , but change the laws . change the global treaties .
in this brand-new slideshow , al gore presents evidence that the pace of climate change may be even worse than scientists recently predicted . he challenges us to act .
and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers , just like designers are seeking scientists .
but the problem is that it &apos;s a really ugly patty .
you know , the whole xo laptop , from one laptop per child , is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking .
mapping and tagging .
there &apos;s another one that throws plates and breaks them .
there was data within the streams of news that we consume .
this blew our mind .
so we look at a process of group dynamics : coalescence and fragmentation , groups coming together , groups breaking apart .
and we see the evolution of alpha through time .
so when i thought about compassion , my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips , where he &apos;s lying there and he says , &quot; i really understand , and i really appreciate how one should love one &apos;s neighbor as one love &apos;s oneself .
so part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick .
this idea of compassion comes to us because we &apos;re made in the image of god , who is ultimately the compassionate one .
he said , &quot; god wants bread . that &apos;s it . god wants bread . i know what god wants . &quot;
and he called the two of them to his office .
so imagine , if you will , that i &apos;m stroking your arm with this feather , as i &apos;m stroking my arm right now .
the lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on -- caused excruciating , burning pain .
it &apos;s successful , as you can see from this video of chandler , who , two months after we first met her , is now doings a back flip .
here is how big of a crater was left .
and again , this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we &apos;re sitting in .
we have to find these things first .
we did move the comet a little tiny bit , not very much , but that wasn &apos;t the point .
the gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe , and the probe has a couple of tons of mass .
an event seen from one point of view gives one impression .
but what they really do , which is very powerful , and that is what governments in the late &apos; 90s started doing if they don &apos;t like independent media companies -- you know , they threaten your advertisers .
i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be .
and second , that i have no idea how to make it work .
but however you put it , you know , the numbers do not make any sense .
the city was closed until early &apos; 90s because , of all things , they were producing glass for tupolev planes .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
but the point is , if we ever survive to actually issue them , find enough investors that this can be considered a success , there &apos;s nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring .
we &apos;ll be talking about them .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
there are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .
then you look at electricity . sure enough . the same rule .
someday we may find some slight hole in that argument .
that was a big unification for those days , although today we take it for granted .
presumably , they mean something supernatural .
how true for lincoln .
so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced , far more educated , far more celebrated rivals .
but even in his wildest dreams , lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach .
so i was certain he would kick me out of the program .
but it also brought home to me the lessons which erik erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life .
and so they said , &quot; well , did you see george washington in there ? &quot;
but as i left that night , i was certain that somehow i &apos;d traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with roy campanella .
doris kearns goodwin : lessons from past presidents
and that night , daniel tells us , at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall , &quot; you are weighed in the balance and found wanting , and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians . &quot;
this is the jewish version of the same story .
the greek invasions ended that .
marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great , generous things of setting the people free .
and so the shah invents an iranian history , or a return to iranian history , that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder .
this is heady national rhetoric , and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return .
during the first three years of life , the brain grows to its full size , with most of that growth taking place in the first six months . the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation .
at 8 , their nappies must be changed , so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children .
many countries have developed national action plans for change .
maybe there &apos;s a little change i can get involved in .
it poisoned his blood . he died when i was 11 .
it wasn &apos;t about the end result .
and the stronger the case and the more detailed it was , the better chance we had of creating this day .
and i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it , and i was thinking , &quot; this is it . this is the possibility of it maybe working .
there was an interest in what was going on .
they were saying they would stop .
we &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
by working together , we can create peace one day .
theirs may be bigger , but ours is better , and it could be better , for example , in that it seems larger than it should be , with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies .
so we &apos;ve used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far , and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way .
and it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
so i think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution , all of the while remaining just a primate brain .
we were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution .
lucy mcrae : how can technology transform the human body ?
anyway , you know every time i make this speech -- it &apos;s not the first time -- but it &apos;s an emotion .
i wondered , what work ?
among them there was my right-hand man , najmuddin .
and najmuddin was staying there , doing everything and reporting on the patients .
everybody was grabbing something .
he said , &quot; you have taught me to walk .
i could not believe .
we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .
i have learned a lot from people like najmuddin , mahmoud , rafi .
that was my story . thank you very much .
and so three months later , just before she returned to the united states , nurses in accra go on strike .
and so i started to argue with these men .
i had an inkling , but i didn &apos;t fully realize it until i went out into the workplace and i went to work at microsoft corporation .
rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war .
we &apos;re trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity , who have the ability to confront the complex problems , ask the right questions , and come up with workable solutions .
these young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership , the real privilege of leadership , which is after all to serve humanity .
patrick awuah : how to educate leaders ? liberal arts
and we can measure this very , very precisely with kepler and trace their effects .
not only that you can , but that you will when they are properly suggested to you .
if someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of denmark named hamlet , you would be insulted and rightly so .
she doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
&quot; did he ever have an electric razor ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
she gives you the names of previous lives , who you were in previous lives .
all the more reason to take the million dollars , wouldn &apos;t you think , sylvia ?
it &apos;s exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of lake tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous .
and we must do something about those problems .
and one of the major gaps in care , almost across the board , is access to safe surgery .
so it seems crazy , but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that i showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment .
here it is back at home at that same hospital , developed a little further , 12 years later , working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics .
we &apos;ve seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this .
so we &apos;re taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it &apos;s intended for , and in a contained , safe environment , evaluating its effectiveness .
it means , &quot; return and get it . &quot; learn from the past .
the last word goes to the great jamaican leader marcus mosiah garvey and the akan people of ghana with their adinkra symbol sankofa , which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children .
like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people , but to animals .
we don &apos;t need animal products , and we certainly don &apos;t need white bread or coke .
now , my math &apos;s a little shaky , but this is pretty good , and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long , but you get the idea .
you didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
who needed it though ? meat was everywhere .
some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well .
this may be organic in letter , but it &apos;s surely not organic in spirit .
to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat 50 percent less meat -- it &apos;s not enough of a cut , but it &apos;s a start .
cruelty : i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypocritically , wouldn &apos;t even consider for our own cats , dogs and other pets .
it &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there .
&#91; in the future , everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes . &#93; what if we flip this ?
but as you &apos;re thinking about narcissus , just don &apos;t fall in love with your own reflection .
so that would be , roughly , 324 people have died since i &apos;ve begun speaking .
another author doesn &apos;t give any numerical estimate , but says the probability is significant that it will fail .
and then , of course , it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades .
and they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that , well , sure , there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people .
we &apos;re just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it .
and then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities .
jh : now is this electromagnetic here , or are these static ?
ts : yeah , well let &apos;s put a couple of canvases .
and then when i did the second one , it really disturbed the piece -- these big blue lines crashing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap .
is that relevant to your work ?
tom shannon , john hockenberry : the painter and the pendulum
then our neighbor pops her head in , and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza .
for instance , me and my sister , when we were little , we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains .
and then my other second set of rules -- i hate to say &quot; rules &quot; because it &apos;s art -- my criteria would be the three h &apos;s , which is head , heart and hands .
nell is interested in agricultural processes , and her work is based in these practices .
well this has sparked a craze in japan , because everyone &apos;s wanting a masterpiece .
and this one &apos;s called &quot; lovemaking nest . &quot;
this is by jason birdsong .
this is one of their founders , gert schaeffer .
and she &apos;s one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists , even though she &apos;s going to be 90 next year .
but it &apos;s become something else .
and i want to tell you how we did that in origami .
and i can put it in this simple equation .
well , if i unfold it and go back to the crease pattern , you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap .
it &apos;s so simple that a computer could do it .
do a little more complicated instrument . &quot;
so , imagine a lens the size of a football field .
and this stent folds down using an origami pattern , based on a model called the water bomb base .
yb : combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there .
we are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly , and in many of the places where it counts the most , women are , in fact , taking control of everything .
and i realized that two things were different this time around .
this has been going on for 40 years now .
and those are all things that women do very well .
they learn much faster .
&quot; who &apos;s the damn man ?
we have the charmless misanthrope .
you can bring your friends , or your colleagues , or your babysitter to walk along with you .
this was one of the leading composers of american music back in the &apos; 70s .
he can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hungry or tired .
it &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .
then i &apos;m very much of the united states , and i have been for 48 years now , since i was a really small child .
already , we represent the fifth-largest nation on earth .
some years ago , i noticed that i had accumulated one million miles on united airlines alone .
and it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing .
wouldn &apos;t that be so cool , and that wouldn &apos;t that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
this was the economic level at which sweden was .
and what will happen in the future ?
the yellow on there is the americas ; dark blue is africa ; brown is europe ; green is the middle east and this light blue is south asia .
i &apos;m a very serious &quot; possibilist . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just australia that has better health than britain .
high vitamin d levels , i think , are a marker for sunlight exposure , and sunlight exposure , in methods i &apos;m going to show , is good for heart disease .
so they &apos;re really an ideal model .
so vitamin d is good for you -- it stops rickets , it prevents calcium metabolism , important stuff .
so what do we think ?
that really has to do with our aging population .
why can &apos;t we ? why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
so , we do regenerate , but for limited distances .
you now have your fully seeded scaffold .
when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient .
this is actually your typical desktop printer .
and then you can see these miniature kidneys that we &apos;ve engineered .
once you get the formula right you can replicate it .
anthony atala : see , at the end of the day , the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise .
we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts .
all three of the founders of netscape had it .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
i sold newspapers .
so not only would he get me one , but i had to get two , and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers , which i did , and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money .
but what i realized was that you had to have options .
and i had this captured market . you didn &apos;t need contracts .
you know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin ? so what , right ?
anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want .
they can come into your account or a sub account or whatever .
cameron herold : let &apos;s raise kids to be entrepreneurs
as one moves up the ladder , values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion .
incredibly , this nation , with all its material , intellectual and spiritual resources , seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas .
in the language of my students , &quot; deep thought matters when you &apos;re contemplating what to do about things that matter . &quot;
the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .
i want to talk about what we learn from conservatives .
i don &apos;t want to get into that , you know ; that &apos;s not my point .
okay , so julian made this video .
ll : and so then , what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
now , tiny little quibble of a footnote : sonny bono , you might say , was a republican , but i don &apos;t buy it .
now that picture of an ecology of creativity , the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity , is that the ecology of creativity we have right now ?
not a single example of reform has been produced yet .
and i see that opting out that happens in childhood , and it moves in and becomes more ingrained , even by the time you get to adult life .
so he &apos;d take people to this two-way mirror looking into the room where the snake was , and he &apos;d get them comfortable with that .
he designs medical imaging equipment , large medical imaging equipment .
but doug &apos;s results that he cared about were much more qualitative .
we see them come up with more interesting , and just more , ideas so they can choose from better ideas .
i &apos;m going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how , through both conscious and unconscious design , we &apos;re impacting these invisible worlds .
if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another , they have very similar ecosystems , but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away , the ecosystem is fundamentally different .
wouldn &apos;t it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones ?
and he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
apple introduced a thing called hypercard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
and the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in edinburgh , and i had no opposition in having tim berners-lee as the keynote speaker .
i believe this is a farsi word for &quot; immortal . &quot;
which is obvious . it &apos;s a great name .
thank you .
since i was a student , i wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in gando .
and the classroom , the ceiling is made out of both of them used together .
we start cutting them , and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete , and you have this result .
and my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves .
it &apos;s new technology . you look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
voice : if you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
voice : i think you got your birthday wish.mt : and that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
china is not like the west , and it will not become like the west .
i &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
let me offer you another building block to try and understand china -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western history .
and yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience , looking at it through western eyes , using western concepts .
there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago -- copenhagen , climate change conference .
so this is a solution to a situation where china &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
the heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
and the light that shone off of her eyes was a place i could have stayed forever .
each trip was an excursion , was an adventure .
all of them are not angels , but they &apos;re not monsters either .
we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
and i would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , &quot; so can you tell me who is who ? &quot;
three kids -- that was three students -- were &#91; detained &#93; by the army because they were not carrying their papers .
i &apos;m not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
some people question , &quot; why is it in black and white ?
okay , india .
women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities , and the women kept that dynamic after we left .
so i did . that &apos;s paris .
so now my wish is : i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project , and together we &apos;ll turn the world inside out .
secondly , population growth and density into cities .
they targeted to universities .
whipcar , which started april of last year , it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service .
and so there &apos;s about seven or eight cities already in the u.s .
in closing , and as we &apos;re moving towards the end , i just also want to encourage -- and i &apos;m willing to share my failures as well , though not from the stage .
it took from the stone age to achieve that .
this is a dust mite on a nanoreplica .
and then , the systemic risks .
ian goldin : navigating our global future
my father believed in a holistic approach to living , and , you know , every time he taught us , he &apos;d say , &quot; i hate these books , because these books are hijacked by industrial revolution . &quot;
i hopped into his car , and off we went through the remaining layers of security .
so i said , &quot; i am dead , so i need to be born again . &quot;
you know , normally you work in isolation , and you show at a gallery , but here , the work was coming alive , and it had some other artists working with me .
since i mentioned my wife , the most important collaboration has been with her , netra .
i loved the attention .
i lost all my audiences .
and i thought the best way , as most of you know who have children , the best way to have a new lease on life , is to have a child .
i met belinda when she was 16 .
sw : yeah .
little splat at the end there . einstein , did that hurt ?
e : yar .
sw : good job !
sw : she &apos;s a comedian . i suppose you think you &apos;re famous ? are you famous ?
you could jump off the end into the deep end .
swimming , first principles .
but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left , maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible .
languages . material versus method .
and so it came to me in waves .
and now i love languages .
and proceeded to look at -- i wanted to set competition so i &apos;d have a deadline -- parkinson &apos;s law , the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it .
he didn &apos;t lead with his chest , which requires you lean forward .
i know nothing . i &apos;m a beginner .
now not surprisingly , that influenced some people to think we were onto something .
and it takes place in an area called the shephelah in what is now israel .
you &apos;re this kid . this is this mighty warrior . &quot;
and there &apos;s artillery , and artillery are archers , but , more importantly , slingers .
there &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
and throughout history , many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly .
and sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket .
the microbes that cover us .
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
well , one thing that animals seem to do is , they eat poo -- coprophagia .
thank you .
so this is where we get to yochai &apos;s discussion .
so a german magazine compared german wikipedia , which is really much , much smaller than english , to microsoft encarta and to brockhaus multimedia , and we won across the board .
we should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it .
these are the people who are doing the bulk of the site , and they are , in a sense , semi-professionals at what they &apos;re doing , that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality .
and then somebody says , &quot; wait , wait , wait , wait , i found it .
i was describing this in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said , &quot; i am the queen of england . &quot;
jimmy wales : yeah , so , a lot of teachers are beginning to use wikipedia .
his name was jasaw chan k &apos;awiil .
&quot; fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you .
it &apos;s part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain , associated with wanting , with motivation , with focus and with craving .
how , you know , what have i lost ?
and she was driving along in her car the other day , and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man .
and so , i &apos;ve spent the last three years on this .
i think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face , cajoling it , reprimanding it , educating it with words .
and i did not bring the tools here to long beach .
in the end , the grass is often greener on my side of the fence , although we don &apos;t realize it .
so decades ago , not years ago , i set out to find a place in the world where i could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system .
and this is the best-studied sound , because it &apos;s easy to measure , really , and you &apos;d find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting , for example .
now , it &apos;s important to remember that you &apos;re only hearing the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds , and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds , and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds .
and that &apos;s the scarf whistle , which is also associated with a visual symbol .
so i &apos;m reaching over . she &apos;s got the scarf on her right side .
likewise , we can create our own whistles , our own whistle names , and let the dolphins request specific divers to interact with .
and the song is based on what i think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces .
he is over the english channel and underway .
you have no machine around you .
just , i try to keep my mobility through new activities .
we saw the 2009 crossing of the gibraltar strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean .
civil aviation is something that we know very well .
there is big thermal activity , big difference in altitude also .
but what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know .
what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid , open-ended discovery ?
empiricism is inadequate because , well , scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen .
brains only detect nerve impulses .
what does that mean ? well , explanation is an assertion about what &apos;s there , unseen , that accounts for what &apos;s seen .
no easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres .
there are just way too few eye care professionals .
and i have a vision , which i &apos;ll share with you .
i have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
in a series of shows that includes &quot; 100 percent vancouver , &quot; &quot; 100 percent berlin , &quot; rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society .
i think what &apos;s so brilliant about the festivals , the new festivals , is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today .
&#91; &quot; &apos; alice &apos;s adventures in wonderland &apos; &quot; &#93; alice : what &apos;s happening to me ?
what in the heck was i thinking ?
but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it .
and here we are diving in the beaufort sea .
i got very nervous -- no rope , no safety line , the whole world is moving around me -- and i thought , &quot; i &apos;m in trouble . &quot;
so this is that story .
and so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin , came under the boat , the zodiac , starting hitting the hull of the boat .
the penguin swims toward me , takes off .
she would , i think , let me know that i was going to starve .
even more than that , what about predicting human behavior ?
but i have a different theory about that , that model of attention .
it &apos;s hard to tell where to start , there &apos;s so many great things .
ar : good . i &apos;m not going to actually put my hand in your pocket .
it &apos;s back on your shoulder .
no , don &apos;t reach in your pocket . that &apos;s a different show .
if you could control somebody &apos;s attention , what would you do with it ?
and after that initial prototype , we set out to make free and open-source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did .
thirty kenyan shillings . that &apos;s six times the cost to connect within africa .
and for us , we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in kenya .
we need to look for something else , and we &apos;ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut .
the first guy -- we &apos;ll call him adam -- is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form .
and please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or conservative .
nature provides a first draft , which experience then revises .
here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species .
in-group , authority , purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality . i reject it . &quot;
the answer , i think , is contained in this incredible triptych from hieronymus bosch , &quot; the garden of earthly delights . &quot;
it &apos;s not enough to just appeal to people &apos;s good motives .
traditional authority , traditional morality can be quite repressive , and restrictive to those at the bottom , to women , to people that don &apos;t fit in .
these two stanzas contain , i think , the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology .
jonathan haidt : the moral roots of liberals and conservatives
they &apos;re going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop .
and of course , being australian , i started looking at stuff in australia , knowing , again , from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in australia .
thousand is getting better .
virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas .
&quot; police chief fires taser into 14 year-old girl &apos;s head . &quot;
what would these guys have done if they &apos;d had access to tasers or to a manned , portable version of the active denial system -- a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it .
but we hold them in san francisco -- -- and in new york .
and here he &apos;ll explain a little bit about what it does .
with our strengths and our minds and spirit , we gather , we form , and we fashion .
this is jeff and bilal and several others here in a hackerspace .
these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars , and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers .
an the answer to the question : what will america make ?
and there is , of course , this glamour .
it may be to illuminate the star ; it may be to sell a film .
mel gibson &apos;s &quot; passion of the christ &quot; -- not glamorous .
anyway , skylines are super glamorous , city streets -- not so glamorous .
you have to have mystery and you have to have grace .
this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia .
this is from &quot; triumph of the will &quot; -- brilliant editing to cut together things .
and , actually , you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it .
it was an ecstatic experience .
other women became mad , driven machines like me .
cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .
the flowers make it beautiful , and the honey makes it sweet . &quot;
it was underpaid and really loving nurses .
but as a scientist , i &apos;m interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one i &apos;m going to introduce to you today .
the first thing i &apos;m going to show you is a change between age three and five , as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own .
so which one do you think ivan is going to take ?
but now i &apos;m going to show you the five-year-old .
how many people think it was morally permissible for grace to put the powder in the coffee ?
when you hear clicks , we &apos;re turning the machine on .
i mean , they &apos;re calling , but i &apos;m not taking the call .
you &apos;re a brilliant young neuroscientist .
i mean , these are sort of the extreme examples , and they &apos;re amusing and good to laugh at .
you think of , you know , urbanization , consumerism , the workplace , technology .
and in this , towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another .
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout , pleading with me to write to their parents , to help them slow down , to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill .
or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work .
and i have a kind of hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon , which goes a little bit like this : a few months ago , i was getting ready to go on another book tour , and i had my bags packed .
and there were all kinds of exciting features : you could come in through the landside buildings , walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape .
there &apos;s an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space .
within the working drawings !
you see the structure as , in the sequence of structures on the mall , very transparent and inviting and looking in .
okay , i have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
if you played an e .
and i know that i speak for all of us when i tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
thank you .
do you see me simply smothered in cloth ?
i just really wanted to acknowledge you .
and the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
it really does need fresh water .
and i didn &apos;t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
you &apos;re too keen . you &apos;re too keen . no . hang on . hang on .
it stretches about 500 miles , of course it &apos;s india here .
that &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
they only take six weeks . instead of 11 months , they &apos;re six weeks .
the dragonflies are here now . they &apos;re breeding there .
but dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
they have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from india to africa . includes this one , the hobby .
as a kid , i grew up on a farm in florida , and i did what most little kids do .
here are some tricks that i started to bring to that new terrain .
and indeed i did . it was the very first thing i filmed , which was awesome .
and the beauty of skateboarding is that , no one guy is the best . in fact , i know this is rotten to say , they &apos;re my friends , but a couple of them actually don &apos;t look that comfortable on their board .
i &apos;ve been all around the world , and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name , and it &apos;s such a weird , visceral experience .
and so many people , i guess , watch those videos .
it weighs about 50 lbs .
and the box is handcuffed to one of the guards .
well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant ?
zero , not a single one .
we think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that .
well , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about today , is how we &apos;re using the tools of genetics , population genetics in particular , to tell us how we generated this diversity , and how long it took .
digging things up out of the ground , and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped , often skull shape -- saying , &quot; this looks a little bit more like us than that , so this must be my ancestor .
because what we &apos;re really asking is a genealogical problem , or a genealogical question .
it doesn &apos;t happen very often . we have a proofreading mechanism built in .
such an amazing story .
the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time , roughly 70,000 years ago , crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals .
and when they reached central asia , they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway , a grassland super-highway .
you can order a kit . you can test your own dna .
what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order , lack of structure -- in fact , to mush .
around us , there &apos;s nothing .
and this is how it works .
what are the goldilocks conditions ?
so , dna contains information about how to make living organisms .
but it is so slow .
so fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us .
let &apos;s start with mortgages .
and i know it sounds crazy .
how many people end up saving to a 401 plan ?
the same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later .
that &apos;s kind of too much effort .
they &apos;re really mad .
but what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion ?
this is really the tip of the iceberg .
so we are past our 1,000th show .
hi there .
so , i was just asked to go and shoot this film called &quot; elizabeth . &quot;
so i come up , and i say , &quot; what am i going to do today ? &quot; i &apos;m not going to do what i planned to do , and i put myself into absolute panic .
panic is the great access of creativity because that &apos;s the only way to get rid of your mind .
what was my story ?
i don &apos;t know ; i &apos;m not sure , but that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done all the time .
and the two divine people fought , and the gods were on the side of divinity .
bess : yes , my lady .
shekhar kapur : so , what am i trying to do here ?
so how does that become a story ?
and all of us are constantly looking for harmony .
i was going to work with small farmers .
within a year , rainforest crunch was on the shelves .
we live on a planet .
you think that &apos;s not an issue going forward ?
okay , so let &apos;s be generous .
everybody &apos;s got to work together -- china and the u.s .
and if you go through the first 25 or 30 names of each of the commodities , what you begin to see is , gosh , there &apos;s cargill here , there &apos;s cargill there , there &apos;s cargill everywhere .
and yet , next week , we launch globally verified , vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture .
we don &apos;t have to change the way a single chinese company works if we get cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to china .
this is called bundling . it &apos;s bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .
but how to make it happen ?
as soon as the treadmill belt starts moving , the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg , but without the brain .
i mean , how is it possible ?
this defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system .
and she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother .
what he said , that all too often , is that we accept the distance between those two ideas .
and by getting a good education , you too can control your own destiny .
it &apos;s an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations .
i can &apos;t make noise .
no other way dans l &apos;espace , so help to have the fruits
the internet has no business plan , never did .
instead , again , it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater , but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us .
how did this happen ?
i have a theory i can explain later .
the film , without his permission or even knowledge at first , found its way onto the internet .
is that an animal carcass behind her ? &quot;
but it &apos;s the rideshare board , and it &apos;s basically the same thing .
in the &apos; 90s , it was 13th , and not because standards had fallen , but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere .
a lot of potential of young children is wasted .
this is the blue bar which is driving costs down .
for example , traditionally , the education of the very young children where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten .
and you know what &apos;s interesting ? you won &apos;t believe it , but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school .
they set very ambitious standards , but then they enable their teachers to figure out , what do i need to teach to my students today ?
but pisa has shown what &apos;s possible in education .
it empowered authorities , and , as a result , marginalized citizens .
so i had another unproductive day .
but how would you specialize ?
but again , it &apos;s very paternalistic .
if you think it can be done , come and make it happen . &quot;
&quot; governments need to subsidize private companies . &quot;
and that changed my mindset forever .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the west .
and we will see , you know .
but they did recover quite fast afterwards .
in &apos; 92 india follows with a market reform .
and i can understand him , because washington , d.c .
you see it came down there .
so , always avoid war , because that always pushes human beings backward .
in these galaxies , especially in a spiral galaxy like this , most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy .
it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .
yes ! the rays would lie on a -- i &apos;d like to see -- yeah , on a cone .
do we see arcs in the sky when we look at , say , a cluster of galaxies ?
so they &apos;re moving further apart .
do we have anything for dark matter ? and the answer is yes .
physicist patricia burchat sheds light on two basic ingredients of our universe : dark matter and dark energy . comprising 96 % of the universe between them , they can &apos;t be directly measured , but their influence is immense .
i thought this was unacceptable . so i decided to do something about it .
in all schools in indonesia , there is usually a toy seller in the playground .
and this is a pretty well-educated audience , so i imagine you all know something about aids .
over a period from &apos; 84 to &apos; 88 , that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent .
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
it &apos;s not the only place we had any interventions .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to hiv .
and hiv is actually particularly closely linked to transit .
so you can see that both of these series -- the black line is export value , the red line is new hiv infections -- you can see they &apos;re both increasing .
and that is that we live in a competent universe , that we are part of a brilliant planet , and that we are surrounded by genius .
he would come every day with something to show me .
he happened to be a birder .
and the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips .
and it &apos;s in every cell .
energy use . organisms sip energy , because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get .
and what we &apos;re saying is that , shouldn &apos;t our cities do at least as well , in terms of ecosystem services , as the native systems that they replace ?
you know , i think there might be some presentations that will go over my head , but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet .
and chip taylor , our monarch butterfly expert , he replied , &quot; nothing lasts forever .
my father defied his own grandfather , almost to the point of disinheritance , because he decided to educate all four of us .
but that response comes out of those 90 points .
that &apos;s the reason , as a woman , i joined the indian police service .
this is a visual of education inside the prison .
this was one of the most courageous steps i took as a prison governor .
friends , you will hear a lot about it .
and then about a year and a half ago , google actually acquired this company .
so you start with a book , and then you scan it .
and this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing captchas on the internet .
okay , so this is my favorite number of recaptcha .
if you don &apos;t know any english , you can &apos;t access it .
okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
so it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
this is a sentence that was translated from german into english .
so the nice thing about duolingo is i think it provides a fair business model -- one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
what do they bring ? they bring this fabulous diversity , expensive for companies . and what does that deliver ?
who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up would beat out google video ? why ?
so going back , this is my look of excitement and joy , because all this stuff that i &apos;d also been hoping for actually really did happen , and what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
and finally a mind-wandering question : are you thinking about something other than what you &apos;re currently doing ?
thank you .
and i had become ashamed of the other , the african in me .
the rhetoric of the candidates , of course , changed .
ghana found itself in the same place in which the u.s. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections -- bush versus gore .
and when surfers are out waiting for waves , you probably wonder , if you &apos;ve never been out there , what are they doing ?
but both started exploring it .
he said , ok , we &apos;re going to start having these meetings .
but the general idea that you could only -- you could only really talk about things in that place that had some kind of experimental basis .
and i didn &apos;t mean , you know -- where is that lady ?
it burned kind of slow , but it made a nice smell , compared to other rocket fuels i had tried , that all had sulfur in them .
because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody &apos;s goddamn way of doing molecular biology .
that &apos;s back when travel was easy .
so you still get heated , but you don &apos;t dissipate any .
i was pre-med at the time , and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity .
it &apos;s now an empty , six-acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea .
you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching .
this was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people .
i had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- i guess , except for in this picture .
i think we agree on that . where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair , right ? where does all this stuff come from ?
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bulb , and said , &quot; can you do it ? &quot; they couldn &apos;t do it . right ?
that &apos;s pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper . right ?
poor teaching actually does more harm than good .
before we do that , i want to kind of put biology in its place .
and all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago , and they look alive .
if we can make matter alive , would we have a matterhazard ?
imagine way back , four and a half billion years ago , there is a vast chemical soup of stuff .
they took the basic ingredients , put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through .
and so with this lego kit , we have the diversity required for complex information storage without dna .
and we don &apos;t use design anymore . we find what works .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s a four percent reduction per year -- and this , with measuring .
are they alive ?
but now , when you have this trend line , how do we measure progress ?
we in public health , we hate child death , so we want less and less and less of child deaths .
their countries are so different , and they merit to be recognized in the same way , as we don &apos;t talk about europe as one place .
let me show you thailand , see what a success story , thailand from the 1960s -- how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as sweden .
what has happened ?
how the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
what we don &apos;t look for is value for many , while we are generating value for money .
and when i finished my ssc , the eleventh standard , i stood eleventh among 125,000 students .
and at a point in time , he got so engrossed in the whole challenge , that he himself became a member of the team .
and therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
here is an american citizen and his son having an artificial foot .
&quot; no ... not at all . &quot;
for example , we don &apos;t want 20,000 dollars ; we don &apos;t have it .
and he also said , &quot; i would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all . &quot;
and there &apos;s a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created .
one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens .
i &apos;m trying to build a global team , which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing .
i &apos;ve gotten a lot of inspiration from steve jobs , and i &apos;ve started an app club at school , and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club .
and i thought , you know , is this the best way to do it ?
that &apos;s how much thermal energy the reactor &apos;s putting out to how much electricity it &apos;s producing .
so i really think that in the , say , 20 years it &apos;s going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality , this could be the source of energy that provides carbon-free electricity .
and i &apos;ll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with , which is weird for a scientist .
i talk about theme restaurants , and experiential retail , and boutique hotels , and las vegas -- the experience capital of the world .
and then i always finish off by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question , particularly coming from the dutch , is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland .
and those three verses are the core of authenticity .
right ? is it really in the city ?
right , if you could check into the ads , you &apos;d have a great experience .
i would go into these private places , and i would put my ideas and my passions into objects -- and sort of learning how to speak with my hands .
and that &apos;s a little found object .
now , a completely different thought .
now here , i &apos;m going to do a very poor job of silver soldering .
so i &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
45 days embryo &apos;s heart is beating twice as fast as the mother &apos;s .
where does this intelligence of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information , so as you actually watch the baby &apos;s brain grow -- and this is one of the things that we &apos;re doing right now .
so if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids , you will have this lithium-6 isotope in the spectrum of the star .
and we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars , galaxies , nebulae .
i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy .
so which means that it &apos;s really impossible to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon , five times more calcium than oxygen . it &apos;s just impossible .
now , we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets .
and with the known physics etc , it &apos;s something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake , many years ago , and shklovsky .
so , i &apos;ll start with this : a couple years ago , an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event .
and so to think that i had found my way , to found a career that takes me -- really , one of the big sayings in social work is , &quot; lean into the discomfort of the work . &quot;
no one wants to talk about it , and the less you talk about it the more you have it .
and the first words that came to my mind were whole-hearted .
i call it a breakdown ; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening .
thank you .
because i wanted to know what &apos;s out there .
just certain .
we do that corporate -- whether it &apos;s a bailout , an oil spill , a recall -- we pretend like what we &apos;re doing doesn &apos;t have a huge impact on other people .
now , we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices , the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing , and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors .
last year , apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation , heart rate and body temperature via the earbuds .
i want to talk about it in the context of a story .
not stories in words , but stories in data and words .
so , anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day , and see if they &apos;re doing better , they probably are .
so , you click down on the als tab there .
you &apos;ve seen multiple of these today , when everyone &apos;s bragging about the amazing things they &apos;ve done .
so , i said , &quot; okay well we can &apos;t do that . then we can do something harder . &quot;
so , you can see we matched them perfectly , perfectly .
it &apos;s the first version of the time machine .
and yet i think it &apos;s this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions .
as we were working on this incredible discovery at university of florida , we were told to go down the corridor to visit another scientist , and he was working on a pretty incredible thing .
ebox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside , hold it until you need it , and then be able to release it and pass it off .
and whenever i go round to somebody who says , &quot; you know what , you &apos;re working on something that &apos;s too difficult .
i ended up in physics by accident .
so what equations are for physics , complex networks are for the study of complex systems .
a high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability , because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic .
if you want to compute the flow in an ownership network , this is what you have to do .
now there is still a big problem , in my opinion .
if anything changes -- if the environment changes , the ground moves , or demand changes -- we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them .
and we gave them away to all the tedsters .
and it also might just be the manufacturing technique that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future .
and on the other side were all my sister &apos;s my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge .
that &apos;s no problem , as most of you know , because i can just delete that dot .
bobo married amy the unicorn .
and if we change it , if we change our formula for happiness and success , what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality .
and if happiness is on the opposite side of success , your brain never gets there .
shawn achor : the happy secret to better work
he walked into a safeway once on a rainy day , slipped , broke his arm , rushed out : he didn &apos;t want to inconvenience safeway .
i got my masters , and then went to art school after that .
now , i was saying , well , that &apos;s the whole point : it &apos;s moving .
it &apos;s put inside the computer .
he &apos;s the guy that kind of discovered me , and kind of got me going in digital media .
so , i was wondering , like , what is this thing in front of me , this computer thing ?
the world is just so tasty .
however , recently this risd opportunity kind of arose -- going to risd -- and i couldn &apos;t reconcile this real easy , because the letters had told me , mit forever .
first , i want to start by saying , this is a boy , and this is a girl , and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl .
and so we &apos;re starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university .
i don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
you &apos;ll see , the conversation changes depending upon who &apos;s sitting around the table .
more specifically , we can do some very specific things .
but if it were your culture , think of how that might feel .
and according to the higgs theory , at that instant , a dramatic event took place in the universe .
we may not realize it in ordinary life , but the intensity of the higgs field is critical for the structure of matter .
and indeed , a possible answer to my question opens up new universes , literally .
and i &apos;m not a dj , and i &apos;m not a musician , so i &apos;m a little bit scared of that .
you change its environment , and the object will flow .
you can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly , and when you touch it , you can hear the music that &apos;s described on the top , which is something you can &apos;t read .
oh , yes . i just love doing that .
you know , just like people on the street when you get too close to them .
and if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day , the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day .
a sport pilot can be certificated in as little as 20 hours of flight time .
that was beautiful from up here , i tell you .
the transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller , more accessible place .
what on earth is wrong with placebos ?
now , 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life , which is if something is worth guarding , it &apos;s worth stealing .
in britain we tend to feel , &quot; whoa ! got another three ! &quot;
when i grew up , this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food .
i &apos;ll give you one example .
so i just want to get your first impressions when you see that , when you see the diamond shreddies box there .
so they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display , and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest , simplest things in life . which is magic .
i felt i was not alive anymore .
susan blackmore : someone says no , very loudly , from over there .
you try them all in order : mmm ... ?
information that we copy from person to person , by imitation , by language , by talking , by telling stories , by wearing clothes , by doing things .
there are plenty more in the shops .
the memes are all trying to get copied -- trying , in inverted commas -- i.e. , that &apos;s the shorthand for , if they can get copied , they will .
the memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine .
intelligence appears all over the place , in all kinds of guises .
think of the big brain .
don &apos;t think , &quot; oh , we created the internet for our own benefit . &quot;
maybe we will , maybe we won &apos;t .
we inspected schools and private residencies .
and they redid that building .
and as you can imagine , i hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity .
all of these would have been great things to do , and my nurses had no idea .
and you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it &apos;s worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
the moment people thought about trying to recall the ten commandments , they stopped cheating .
our subjects doubled their cheating .
we ran this at carnegie mellon and pittsburgh .
more generally , i want to tell you something about behavioral economics .
and i am going to tell you the answer , but obviously after this short break .
but you get the gist , so people have really started to sort of lose faith in institutions .
and i &apos;ll get you back to tide , the detergent now , as i promised .
it seems farfetched , but when you think about it , in america in 1860 , there were 1,600 corporations issuing banknotes .
and the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals .
instead they &apos;re more like reinforced water balloons .
it had the central fluid , it had the surrounding wall , and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton .
why was everyone surprised at this ?
natalie macmaster : i &apos;m going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here .
and i said , &quot; i know you .
let &apos;s get her going .
nm : it worked . dl : it worked .
so i &apos;d like to share with you a story about a self-study , self-empowering computer science course that i built , together with my brilliant colleague noam nisan .
and indeed , for quite a few people , taking this nand2tetris pilgrimage , if you will , has turned into a life-changing experience .
well , if you try to tile it , it doesn &apos;t work too well , does it .
i would love my children to be able to meet my family in the congo .
the state-regulated mining industry has collapsed , and control over mines has splintered .
we need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies to change their sourcing processes .
in reality , no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business , so you are going to muddle by , understaffed .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
but throughout the economy , there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us .
could we use the same model ?
this would be a world of very small trades , but very well-informed , because national e-markets will deliver data .
when she got up to make tea , she placed him in my own lap and i had never felt a child that was that emaciated .
i &apos;ve always been very worried about resource .
and sorry about that , but this is what turns me on .
and it &apos;s this reaction that we want to do .
so , how would we make it ?
we have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology .
but i &apos;m going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women , revealing some surprises along the way .
so while economic development made a few people rich , it left many more worse off .
and this hope , this optimism , endured a year of turbulent transition .
what about men &apos;s views of religion and law ?
and this isn &apos;t some suburban iphone-using teen phenomenon .
it &apos;s real time .
this is really , to me , the power of texting and the power of data .
that was 1903 .
the third stage has a camera .
it does not eat nectar .
there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe .
it allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group .
but there isn &apos;t anyone else ; there &apos;s just you .
no , there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed .
but there &apos;s something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you &apos;d recognize .
regina , that was jaw-dropping , as they say .
what good is it to build a zero-carbon , energy efficient complex , when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best ?
they aren &apos;t supposed to be out at large . &quot;
at the beginning , it was a disaster .
i had an image of lance armstrong in my mind .
and you say , &quot; hey , alex . look at this parking lot where we started .
and i feel blessed and fortunate that every week , every tuesday -- and actually every friday also -- i can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in israel on the edge .
i grew up on the coast of england in the &apos; 70s .
i would put all my emotional expression into my dancing .
my desire to disappear was still very powerful .
i thought i lacked substance , and the fact that i could feel others &apos; meant that i had nothing of myself to feel .
simple awareness is where it begins .
and just very quickly , something we &apos;ve been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again .
so we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other .
the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station .
but you just have to go to a garden center , and they &apos;re in little paper packets .
and then , you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur -- in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral , in effect , we &apos;ve shaved it .
the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this .
the &quot; blank slate &quot; was an influential idea in the 20th century .
the foremost is that if we &apos;re blank slates , then , by definition , we are equal , because zero equals zero equals zero .
well , the night is young , but the book has been out for half a year , and nothing terrible has happened .
students are staying away in droves , universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities .
and the starting point is the -- for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex .
steven pinker : human nature and the blank slate
ok , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
we don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse -- we shoot what we get !
i said , &quot; a day ! how long does it take them to fall off ? &quot;
and i can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and i can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so i did what i had to do .
these discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and i &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , i have them all the time , but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that i just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
follow your passion -- we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
no , i mean really .
it &apos;s a civil war .
all of that ? that &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
and it lists currently 374 mental disorders .
and he said , &quot; hardly anything .
and he said , &quot; yep . yep . absolutely . i beat someone up when i was 17 .
how do you cross your legs in a sane way ?
he was a psychopath .
and i emailed him and i said , &quot; i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless .
can i go through them with you ? &quot;
and we stitch them together like medieval monks .
and for the last 20 months everything was fine .
that &apos;s why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol , for example .
you know , post-9 / 11 , we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of george w. bush saying , &quot; islam means peace . &quot;
and it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other , and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them .
and one furthermore has the impulse to generalize , as much as possible , in defining who that enemy is .
and soon , nearly 20,000 penguins were covered with this toxic oil .
now mind you , three days earlier , we had 60 penguins under our care , so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least i was .
but an interesting thing was noted during the training process .
and they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
we &apos;ve got edible canal towpaths , and we &apos;ve got sprouting cemeteries .
they want positive actions they can engage in , and in their bones , they know it &apos;s time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment .
and what we did was we put people on our egg map .
if we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow , then please let us say to every school , create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment , local food and soils .
and to my astonishment , when i began seriously studying other traditions , i began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today -- is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west , in about the 17th century .
go and study it . &quot;
i &apos;ve just come back from pakistan , where literally thousands of people came to my lectures , because they were yearning , first of all , to hear a friendly western voice .
that is the ethos found , too , in all the religions .
when i first saw living cells in a microscope , i was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like .
but when you look closer at this , look at what &apos;s there .
this is some micrometeorites that the army gave me , and they get these out of the drinking wells in the south pole .
and i &apos;m still fundamentally using the same principles today .
the creases in the material and the sort of nuances .
a lot more than you &apos;d get in a hospital or a vet &apos;s .
but this time i had to use a real body .
the fact that it &apos;s a child &apos;s toy that we all recognize , but also it looks like it &apos;s a robot , and it comes from a sci-fi genus .
the thicker the object , the more radiation it needs , and the more time it needs .
and then , so you can get in the driver &apos;s side , sit down , and up against you is a wall .
so the main element though , the main complaint we get -- and one that i find most worrying -- is that people say , &quot; oh , why do you insist on ruining the magic ?
well , there is one proviso .
and that is all of these different things -- the love for my child .
even on my journey up here -- the joy that i have on my journey up here every single time .
robin ince : science versus wonder ?
maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
and i say to tony , &quot; let &apos;s do this . &quot;
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &quot; short circuit . &quot;
and this is happening here .
it has probably not helped my waistline any because i like practicing on both sides .
but does it just happen over there ?
well , when he was oil minister , he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that , guess what , yeah , he was the hidden owner of .
now , the africa progress panel , led by kofi annan , they &apos;ve calculated that congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals .
so in effect , what ? we just accept it .
people change us . nothing is secure .
and so you spend your days fighting things off , defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking .
they have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator .
for eight years , she walked through the rift valley .
we come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time , moving towards a new place .
i just become skanky .
because this is treating your audience like a moron .
and sure enough , somebody from mca universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image , just in case they might want to use it .
now to me , this was always going to be a typographic solution , what i would call the opposite of type 101 .
huhh ! they &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
so even if you don &apos;t know anything about this book , you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence .
thank you .
true story , by the way .
no matter your position or place in life , it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away .
some of it is controlled , like music or theater , but most of it is chaotic and incoherent , which some of us refer to as noise .
you can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page , but notice what &apos;s missing in the top two thirds .
but you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world .
but our school at that time got a grant from the government , and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3dz -- and they left the programming manuals lying around .
and in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program .
all video games are violent .
and the people that went there absolutely loved it .
i came across a student who &apos;s absolutely excellent at expressing himself , and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it .
video games are nearing an evolutionary leap , a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres , or the news we watch on tv .
i , however , have a problem very close to home .
but as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way i do .
he &apos;s out of time .
and of course , if you &apos;re a speaker here , like hans rosling , a speaker finds this complex , tricky . but in hans rosling &apos;s case , he had a secret weapon yesterday , literally , in his sword swallowing act .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
so they &apos;re cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up .
but of course , that &apos;s a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car , so the kids want to do a steering wheel ; so they draw a steering wheel .
ak : so obviously , aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because , of course , he didn &apos;t bother doing the experiment , and neither did st. thomas aquinas .
that means that we , once again , have a thing where we can put technology out , but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new ichat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing .
life is short , you know .
it &apos;s going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine .
and it &apos;s going to be used for diet as well , and nutritional supplements and such .
we &apos;re sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior .
those kinds of loose analogies with computers , and with programming , are actually much deeper than that .
and they depend too much upon history , upon philosophy , upon religion , upon culture , upon politics .
they are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives , of their society , of their future .
&quot; the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them , both glory and danger alike .
we have evolved to have our own pond .
and i said , &quot; ... &quot;
she goes , &quot; what about dogs ? &quot;
the only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength .
every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
this is a list of the core team .
research and ethics committee : if you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and ethics .
they don &apos;t want to change .
you can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have .
that makes a good cartoon .
it has rocked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consume music .
we know that cartoons can be used as weapons .
the dozo , they are the traditional hunters of west africa .
the first day , they were even shouting at each other .
patrick chappatte : the power of cartoons
right after , i got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention , and with all great earnestness walked in .
and that will happen , paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit co2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
i mean , it must be true , because we &apos;ve had two hollywood blockbusters since that time , and this paradigm , from 1980 to about 2000 , totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes .
but there &apos;s lots of stuff .
they really want their world back .
well , it &apos;s not the lava that kills anything , it &apos;s the carbon dioxide that comes out with it .
well now , i die .
what are you going to do ?
asteroid strikes get all the coverage , but &quot; medea hypothesis &quot; author peter ward argues that most of earth &apos;s mass extinctions were caused by lowly bacteria . the culprit , a poison called hydrogen sulfide , may have an interesting application in medicine .
either way , they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma .
and the usfda has a jurisdictional problem .
so they formed a white house task force , and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain .
you need a place where people can come together , sit down without fear of judgment , without recrimination , to actually face the problem , agree on the problem and come up with solutions .
the private actors , companies and ngos , are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face .
poor people , people whose human rights have been violated -- the crux of that is the loss of dignity , the lack of dignity .
but i know she will anyway , so instead i &apos;ll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby , because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can &apos;t fix .
okay .
i discovered this bar on manhattan &apos;s lower east side that hosted a weekly poetry open mic , and my bewildered , but supportive , parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that i could .
but it turns out sometimes , poetry can be really scary .
now i know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed , to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you .
i watched her realize that , by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she &apos;s doing , she can create poems that only charlotte can write -- about eyeballs and elevators and dora the explorer .
in the original story , god told sarah she could do something impossible and she laughed , because the first sarah , she didn &apos;t know what to do with impossible .
i was a student in the &apos; 60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and on a personal level , an awakening sense of idealism .
but i was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger .
this man had just been liberated from a hutu death camp .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
i &apos;ve been working on a long project on crime and punishment in america .
the signature weapon of the war is the ied , and the signature wound is severe leg damage .
so for example , you come to the polling station , and a poll station worker asks for your id before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote .
you get one of these ballot forms at random , and then you go into the voting booth , and you mark your choices , and you tear along a perforation .
and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality .
and the color now is the majority religion .
now let &apos;s see what has happened in the world .
these countries have six children per woman .
well i do as i always do .
each card box is one billion people .
and we will be just 10 billion in this world , if the poorest people get out of poverty , their children survive , they get access to family planning .
this is just like a residency program , for those of you that are in medical school .
by day nine , you look at this picture , and you &apos;re horrified .
and in the process , i learned something very important .
but we need to have early detection , early response .
if it happens , how bad do you think it will be ?
hello , ron .
no . i love it .
i worked on forestry issues in wwf .
other companies have sustainability strategies .
and the best thing is , they &apos;ll also last for more than 20 years .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
the electricity is free .
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
i was the freak of the family .
then mother teresa , another mystic warrior , who said , &quot; the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small . &quot;
a couple of weeks ago , i took a conservative tea party woman to lunch .
neither of us had tried to change the other .
i would feel very isolated during these discussions .
during this expedition i expected him to be killed outright , and us as well .
and yes , all of those people killed were male .
45 percent of the 14 million people who live in delhi live in unauthorized slums , which are chronically overcrowded .
how does it work ?
and so it came in from the outside .
we ended up sending two people to baghdad to further research that story .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
you know , there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian .
can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
i mean there &apos;s like -- there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
wow .
that begins my translation process .
you place it in an art museum , it becomes a sculpture .
they weren &apos;t sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken , but they were sued because of california &apos;s proposition 65 , which stated that if there &apos;s anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning .
based on these findings , i have a question for you .
and that is where the research began .
but my work wasn &apos;t just about the research .
they &apos;re everywhere .
because these environmental solutions that julie can make in her home , her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her .
&quot; no , no , no ! should be a frog ! &quot;
and the conversation would go something like this , &quot; you know aimee , you &apos;re very attractive .
then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them , and beetroots out the top , and a very lovely brass toe .
it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space .
but i think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
i was representing the shanghai expo .
and because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern oem manufacturing compound in china : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
and then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
how are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
lots of snow in which to dig a den .
the tube-lipped nectar bat .
the stars themselves -- at 12,000 feet , the dry , thin air makes for perfect stargazing .
and in its place , we &apos;d have the opposite of read-write culture , what we could call read-only culture .
now , ascap said they didn &apos;t care .
i want to share all my love with you ...
looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense .
and in a democracy , we ought to be able to do better .
also , the person to your left is a liar .
or we say , favorite of the digiratti , &quot; you know , i just fished that email out of my spam folder .
now when we first hear this data , we recoil .
it &apos;s her cute little , fluffy pet kitten .
i did not have sexual relations with that woman , miss lewinsky .
well guess what , they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth .
we tell very convincing stories , we slightly shrug our shoulders .
we know , for example , we know liars will shift their blink rate , point their feet towards an exit .
diane downs : at night when i close my eyes , i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i &apos;m driving , and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .
when you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking , listening , you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie .
and talking about war , my girlfriend has this great t-shirt that says , &quot; bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity . &quot;
the language actually makes the world in which we live .
my father was educated in cork , in the university of cork , in the &apos; 50s .
now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me .
i am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning .
not because i was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time , but because the way james wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it .
rise and walk away like a panther . &quot;
and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca-cola .
but coke noticed something -- they noticed that local people were taking the product , buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places .
that &apos;s how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people &apos;s potential .
and i think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption , that we think that , if people need something , we don &apos;t have to make them want that .
can you you believe that ?
so what &apos;s the endgame ?
and let me start with this .
and many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
but the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
so you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
so there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . it is building resilience .
and you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
so the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
and on land , this cannot work .
es : thank you very much .
it gets up to about 150 feet long .
this is really a world within a world , and we &apos;re going to show you two .
because we see it in bits and pieces right now .
but they have two types of gill structures .
this is from the atlantic . even greater depth .
we &apos;re moving up one of these pillars .
dg : i already said that this site , from a human perspective , is toxic as hell .
conservation &apos;s tougher , but we can probably get there .
this is really destructive .
you have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
we , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
where is the small hadron collider ?
so if you want recipes to work -- for virtually anything -- health , education , government politics and education -- you have to go to these places .
and the education they got was pitiful .
those girls have never touched google .
one is to deliver extrinsic motivation , that education has a payoff .
pune has 5,000 building sites .
and it &apos;s the same wherever you go .
almost all our effort goes in this box , sustaining innovation in formal settings , getting a better version of the essentially bismarckian school system that developed in the 19th century .
it &apos;s an amazing thing .
and there &apos;s this quote that the main character , arnold , tells his mother as they &apos;re fighting about who he is and the life that he lives .
this is the gay lifestyle .
it &apos;s really quite silly , isn &apos;t it ?
i was blown away when i saw it . i was like , wait , this is the gay agenda ?
if i could brag for a second , i have a 15-year-old son from my marriage .
that &apos;s an entire second adult lifetime that &apos;s been added to our lifespan .
i thought , oh my gosh .
it was about a man named neil selinger -- 57 years old , a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at sarah lawrence where he found his writer &apos;s voice .
how did they treat my parents ?
women start off whole , don &apos;t we ?
now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
and i mean , normally it kind of rolls it away , but in its erect form , that &apos;s what it looks like .
and the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
there &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
here &apos;s another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies , different filters to match the pollinators .
hockey is a game . but really , was this a game ?
so the ships start in england , they come down from england , they go to africa , they go across the ocean -- that &apos;s the middle passage part — they come to america where the slaves are sold , she &apos;s telling me .
so this is a game called síochán leat . it &apos;s &quot; peace be with you . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you a few of the projects that i &apos;ve been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems .
this is looking at ascending versus descending flights .
this was the inspiration for a web service by amazon called the mechanical turk -- named after this guy .
there were 662 rejected sheep that didn &apos;t meet &quot; sheep-like &quot; criteria and were thrown out of the flock .
and this was the inspiration for a project that i worked on with my friend takashi kawashima .
this is what it would look like if you went to the site .
so we put the idea on the back burner for a few months .
so this isn &apos;t finished at all , but it &apos;s an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate .
aaron koblin : visualizing ourselves ... with crowd-sourced data
and people told me -- like these 36 views of the empire state building -- they told me , &quot; you &apos;re making artist books . &quot;
and i &apos;m making all those kinds of windows .
other times , it &apos;s not even my stories .
then i ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons .
that &apos;s another artist book project .
so i made a vegetable point of view of the growth of san jose .
and sometimes it &apos;s about a legacy of the neighborhood , like in morrisania , about the jazz history .
it &apos;s perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm , to be free of career anxiety .
i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods .
we can &apos;t relate to her . she speaks in a funny way .
nowadays , particularly in the united states , if you meet someone at the bottom of society , they may unkindly be described as a &quot; loser . &quot;
insane idea , if you &apos;re a secularist person , like me .
again , a book they were enchanted to discover .
and one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means .
so i &apos;m going to end it there .
alain de botton examines our ideas of success and failure -- and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments . is success always earned ? is failure ? he makes an eloquent , witty case to move beyond snobbery to find true pleasure in our work .
it &apos;s an arduous , difficult sport , and i don &apos;t remember smiling at any time during this sport .
you &apos;ve got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head , because it &apos;s where the hypothermia starts , and so you don &apos;t hear very well .
your body doesn &apos;t like the saltwater .
i need help , and i can &apos;t help diana . &quot;
i &apos;ll just swim right through them .
that &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish i was .
but i &apos;m ready .
this is airstrip technologies .
that signal goes to the web , the cloud , and then it can be processed and sent anywhere : to a caregiver , to a physician , back to the patient , etc .
i didn &apos;t have one of those , but i got the fitbit .
of course how many here have any problems with sleeping ?
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process .
it &apos;s really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it &apos;s hyper-innovative , and i think it represents the black swan of medicine .
okay , there &apos;re lots of problems to worry about .
i don &apos;t think the solutions that i proposed are good enough or smart enough .
and when i &apos;m talking about a long lifetime , of course , i don &apos;t want somebody who &apos;s 200 years old to be like our image of what a 200-year-old is -- which is dead , actually .
but there &apos;s some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established .
it turns out it isn &apos;t because of something called film condensation , and this explains that .
most people assume we use photoshop .
but to make them palatable , we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this .
this is the 30-hour hamburger .
surgeons are the tailors , the plumbers , the carpenters -- some would say the butchers -- of the medical world : cutting , reshaping , reforming , bypassing , fixing .
this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance .
the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe .
this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience .
with all its bells and whistles , one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon .
it has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline .
we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body .
how do you feel about accidents ?
you see , plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade .
you see , i accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture , and as a result , we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice .
throughout this journey , we have also discovered our passion for science , and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university .
this is the land .
but it &apos;s not about them becoming bono or tracy chapman .
because it &apos;s like as bill clinton was saying about rwandan health clinics .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style is grids . let &apos;s make the chair griddy . &quot;
design was not something other .
also rode on one . i ...
so you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional fictional experience there .
at the same time that charles was doing that chair , he was doing this film .
and i also want to share this one .
i went to five countries around the world .
being numerous does not make you a slave .
d : good to have you with us , brent .
they are more expensive in places like north america .
we do not buy people out of slavery .
children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana , reunited with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become slave-proof -- absolutely unenslaveable .
so , a superconductor is defined by two properties .
so what it actually does , it locks these strands , which are called fluxons , and it locks these fluxons in place .
for example , i can make a large circular rail here .
and the situation it describes is the hero of the book -- he &apos;s a 20th-century man -- finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people .
so i ended up going to the history of science library and looking at this book .
so i looked at other ways of making plastic .
i don &apos;t know if you could see , but i was never able to make insulation for the wires .
which will happen around 2020 .
but look at how predictable this is .
some critics say , &quot; oh , well software is stuck in the mud . &quot;
and if we did that , then google would back this .
no one realized that this was a very bad idea .
you don &apos;t even know if it is safe to go back down to the water , to catch a boat to the hospital .
now , i &apos;m going to move now from this kind of -- the sublime in the traditional sense of the word , that is to say , awe-inspiring , terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane .
there may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers , but for the most part the group &apos;s guess would be better than just about all of you .
and that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere , particularly of the political blogosphere , and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful , decentralized , bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .
i said , &quot; look , you &apos;re nuts . that technology &apos;s just not available right now .
but understand what you &apos;re looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female , so that we could put it in any of these people .
and yet , we know more about the surface of the moon and about mars than we do about this habitat , despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food , a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies .
the census actually tried to look back in time , using every source of information they could get their hands on .
so a couple of years ago , i was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and i couldn &apos;t go because of a scheduling conflict .
geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .
so one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity ?
that &apos;s a question for the future .
and what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean .
ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with , as well as ocean warming , and the effects they &apos;re going to have on coral reefs .
so what &apos;s a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses ?
fellow and urban designer mitchell joachim presents his vision for sustainable , organic architecture : eco-friendly abodes grown from plants and -- wait for it -- meat .
there are different paradigms .
now , it &apos;s about five , six , seven , eight pages long , and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page , but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls &quot; moral imagination . &quot;
remember , i have been talking about , essentially philanthropy : the love of humankind , the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action , translated , in some cases , into enlightened self-interest .
and the first thing it does in implanting on that rock , which it never leaves , is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food .
now a lot of robotics is very impressive , but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages .
but more generally , this noise is something that corrupts the signal .
you have data , and data in neuroscience is sensory input .
and i want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback it &apos;s going to get .
and so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling .
and one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys , they get into fights -- which started with one of them doing something to the other , the other retaliating .
and what we &apos;ve measured is the force as a function of terms .
so why is it that we move the particular ways we do ?
so i hope i &apos;ve convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement .
it was taken in 1965 .
this is 2,000 miles across .
it has not been seen publicly .
the reason there is a billion-year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics , the crust of the earth has been recycled .
it &apos;s an aerial regional-scale environmental surveyor .
and we have it in something called an aeroshell .
and we &apos;ve done high-altitude and low-altitude tests , just to perfect this technique .
she &apos;s like , &quot; oh , us . &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; okay . all right . that &apos;s cool . &quot;
and at a certain point , you look around , you &apos;re like , &quot; whoa , this is a really nerdy crowd . &quot;
and don &apos;t kid yourself : some architectural details , incredible organic shapes and just , even , nature out of , again , little blocks .
we went to brazil . we went to china and to india , to bentonville , arkansas , to washington , d.c. and to sacramento .
so , let me tell you this : when wal-mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions , that &apos;s going to be a very big deal . but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not enough .
and bob epstein raised a hand . he stood up .
and you know what ? most consumers who have them don &apos;t even know it .
so , if all goes well , they &apos;re going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels .
that &apos;s about as much co2 as there is in the whole world .
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
but things don &apos;t just diffuse in human populations at random .
a. and you have an immediate appreciation that a is going to be more likely to get the thing that &apos;s spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location within the network .
so , we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .
so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu .
and similar ideas can be used , for instance , to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world .
one is quasi-active , like the flu example i gave , where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends -- do they have the flu , or not ? -- and then get warning .
there &apos;s only one little entrance to the entire building , and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door .
when out on the water , it &apos;s clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living .
like makoko and the torre david , throughout the zabbaleen you &apos;ll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood .
today , you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people .
computers became tools , and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time .
and so i want to tell you today about baxter , which we &apos;ve been talking about .
and the robot figures out , ah , he must mean i want to put stuff down .
and as their tasks become more onerous on them , we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with , so that they can be part of the solution , so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the u.s .
and so i really think that we &apos;re going to be spending more time with robots like baxter and working with robots like baxter in our daily lives . and that we will -- here , baxter , it &apos;s good .
this clearly devastated me , and i couldn &apos;t help but wonder about the fate of my old friends , the winged bulls , and the fate of the many , many heritage sites all over the world .
imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from .
you can look at it from on top , from the ceiling .
two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in rwanda .
to call it a movement , as with all movements , perhaps , is a little misleading .
it does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide .
he was bobby kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist , as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way .
so then you have to make the decision .
here &apos;s this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with , we as citizens are grappling with now . what do we take away ?
we put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we &apos;ve spent three billion .
well after many years working in trade and economics , four years ago , i found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability .
this is a picture of me and my three children .
and i also want to talk about what i call our new burden of knowledge .
and i &apos;m very excited about this , because one thing we &apos;re working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops .
families need the help .
amartya sen won his nobel prize for saying , &quot; guess what , famines happen in the presence of food because people have no ability to buy it . &quot;
and they &apos;re doing this at huge scale after president lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day .
i &apos;m a cancer doctor , and i walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago , and this was the cover of fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy .
because evolution doesn &apos;t care about us after we &apos;ve had our children .
when one is exposed to h1n1 , you take tamiflu , and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease .
the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .
and a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them , because we &apos;re not measuring them dynamically .
if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called taxol every three weeks , which is the standard , about 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug .
so , instead of a reductionist view , we &apos;re taking a step back .
how do i know ?
and certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward , instead of just having encounter and encounter , without fundamental learning .
we also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday .
and that &apos;s not the only thing that bad sound damages .
just leave you with four golden rules , for those of you who run businesses , for commercial sound .
it took us 33 days , 23 hours and 55 minutes to get there .
we were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well , about 10-hour trekking days , 15-hour trekking days , sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal .
what i take from this journey , from my journeys , is that , in fact , within every fiber of my belief standing here , i know that we can make the impossible possible .
since then , i &apos;ve used about 30 kinds of submarines and i &apos;ve started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .
no water , no life ; no blue , no green .
how about some x prizes for ocean exploration ?
the highest concentrations are in red .
protected areas do rebound , but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish , sharks or sea bass , or 200-year-old orange roughy .
and so , i suppose you want to know what my wish is .
well , the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work . but they don &apos;t .
and is it fair to say that it &apos;s simple ?
it &apos;s just very , very tiny , and there &apos;s lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny , tiny neurons .
well , for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world , we &apos;ve been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators .
why are we doing this ?
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .
they were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull .
they choose very carefully who they connect with .
we can position them in different places , orient them in different places .
here we activate it . and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation .
steve told us about the future of little technology ; i &apos;m going to show you some of the past of big technology .
it was the first project funded by arpa .
they built a high-explosive propelled model .
this is crew compartment . it switches , so what &apos;s upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode .
so after being at mit for a few years , i realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting .
and even being here -- i mean the last few days , i &apos;ve known really heights of obsessive behavior i never thought about .
can anybody see them as identical ?
giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how linked you are .
interestingly enough , when people get this , they again don &apos;t check -- but now they join .
and they said , &quot; well , this effect also happens to experts , people who are well-paid , experts in their decisions , do it a lot . &quot;
what happens now ?
or you could get both for 125 .
one more example of this .
are we superman ? or are we homer simpson ?
and it &apos;s this limitation that doesn &apos;t cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month .
and in the middle there , we have this visible light spectrum .
so let &apos;s show how we do that .
this is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here . &quot;
you will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital .
so you could enjoy your most favorite ted video on your long flight back home .
the dna is organized in words , call them : genes and chromosomes .
when you get sick , it is a bug in your genome .
what does a genome look like ?
well , guess what . it does .
our ocean &apos;s teaming with microbes ; in fact , when craig venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean , in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water .
there are microbes out there that actually make gasoline , believe it or not .
we &apos;re going to force you to act against your will , to bend to our will . &quot;
&quot; hold his front paws , squeeze his front paws , stamp on his hind feet , squirt him in the face with lemon juice , hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper , knee him in the chest , flip him over backwards . &quot;
&quot; phoenix , come here , take this , and go to jamie , please . &quot;
they open doors , they drive my car , they massage me , they will throw tennis balls , they will cook for me and serve the food .
and this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital , plus the brother-in-law , plus the child .
rover , come here . rover , come here , you son of a bitch . &quot;
you know , kind of like a little robot .
if it &apos;s good , say , &quot; that was really neat , thank you . &quot;
wk : yeah .
how much electricity ?
thank you so much for coming .
so i &apos;m trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody .
i can see it in their eyes .
the sketches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
so that gives us a form that we can picture , that we can perceive .
words , like numbers , express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world .
none of those things happened , and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
there was no progress , no innovation .
you can have culture without exchange .
if you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
that &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
in all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
people forget that . people think of trade as a modern thing .
there is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
thank you .
one out of four people , one out of four humans in prison are americans , imprisoned in our country .
we just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
bush &apos;s new budget is in the trillions , and these are numbers that our brain just doesn &apos;t have the ability to comprehend .
and so we looked into this a little more carefully , and i &apos;m going to show you data now .
the first thing you do as a scientist is , you make sure stuff works .
it could have lots of bacteria , it could have more than one virus , and it certainly has host genetic material .
here &apos;s another guy . you can play the diagnosis game yourself here .
a normal lung is all sort of dark and black here .
there &apos;s almost no epidemiology or studies on it .
and this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it &apos;s related to other viruses .
with it , we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn &apos;t shine .
this battery needs to be made out of earth-abundant elements .
for me , the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table , enunciated by another professor , dimitri mendeleyev .
and that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people , a mix of graduate students , post-docs and even some undergraduates .
let me share with you some of the surprises , the heterodoxies .
all the footage was taken from our open rov , which is a robot that we built in our garage .
we &apos;ve also learned the penguins love robots .
and since they discovered those things , it really stuck with them so much more , and also they would experience their own failures ; there was a failure-based aspect to learning there . it was very important .
but basically , this is the editor where we &apos;re going to design the next generation of our creature . so it has a little spine .
now really , in some sense , i want the players to be building this world in their imagination , and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain .
so not only will it get hotter , but at some point it &apos;s going to get so hot the oceans will entirely evaporate .
chris was wondering what kind of gods that the players would become .
so what is your body language communicating to me ?
they do this .
like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
so here &apos;s one .
it could be , you know , for some people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting . it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
so when i tell people about this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our outcomes , they say to me , &quot; i don &apos;t -- it feels fake . &quot; right ?
one was that i realized , oh my gosh , i don &apos;t feel like that anymore . you know .
amy cuddy : your body language shapes who you are
the ant &apos;s brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain , inducing suicidal behavior .
the secret of happiness is : find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .
and it &apos;s just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another .
not just the priests . everybody .
sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam , one of the ideologues that inspired osama bin laden .
what you can do , however , is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence .
and the bigger your gesture gets , the more ill-defined , blurry and , frankly , useless it is to the orchestra .
we then thought we &apos;d make a movie of &quot; carmen , &quot; which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside cape town called khayelitsha .
t , see it &apos;s the same as f in music .
there i am like a bloody windmill again , you see .
now in this room with these four disabled musicians , within five minutes a rapt listening , a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music .
but i think it sums up my talk rather well , this , that where there is trust , there is music -- by extension life .
i had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers .
they typically pay for critical goods and services like water , like healthcare , like housing , and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay -- certainly where we work in karachi and nairobi .
the question , though , is not &quot; why can &apos;t we ? &quot;
not coming in with our own notions , because she didn &apos;t even talk about malaria until the very end .
so then they had 18 camels .
the secret to peace is us .
the third side helps us go to the balcony , which is a metaphor for a place of perspective , where we can keep our eyes on the prize .
why do we pay so much attention to this conflict ?
so in that sense , he &apos;s the symbolic third side of the middle east .
so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path , a route -- think the silk route , think the appalachian trail -- that followed in the footsteps of abraham .
men , women , young people , old people -- more women than men , actually , interestingly .
that &apos;s the potential of the abraham path .
that &apos;s walking abraham &apos;s path .
eighty percent of what walked in the door , in terms of illness , was infectious disease -- third world , developing world infectious disease , caused by a poor living environment .
okay . all right .
not well designed , not beautiful , not elegant -- just that they function .
and if you &apos;ve lived in australia in the last 30 years , the final cause -- you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses .
then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally .
we were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground . that &apos;s fine .
i want to end by saying it &apos;s been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing , i think , extraordinary work , that have actually improved health , and , maybe only in a small way , reduced poverty .
one , i care that you spell it right .
or someone who says they don &apos;t like teachers &apos; unions , i bet they &apos;re really devastated to see their kid &apos;s school going into the gutter , and they &apos;re just looking for someone to blame .
and it starts with three people .
so i call this &quot; from south bronx to southampton . &quot;
and when the bronx borough president shows up and the state senator comes to our class , believe you me , the bronx can change attitudes now .
so we were onto something , and we &apos;re still onto something .
and behold the glory and bounty that is bronx county .
all start overage and under-credit .
model good behavior . get them to a green cart .
we discussed , in the prior film , some of the old things that we did , like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic .
then , look at that after three minutes .
your rhythm becomes irregular , and that &apos;s what happened 45 minutes later .
and what we tried was this ; here is a device called the cadwell model mes10 .
the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times , and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches , not only those with aura , get treated and get diminished .
then you saw what that device looked like , that the woman was using to fix her migraines ?
well , how can the ted community help with this situation ?
we took what we knew about africa , the default device , the mobile phone , as our common denominator , and went from there .
so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now .
actually , it &apos;s not about death .
your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair , holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity , to live again and to love again . &quot;
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about and really , how do we get from where we are now to where we need to go ?
it &apos;s a new university in california , in the central valley , working very closely with community colleges .
ok , so what are the enablers ?
ok , the second big enabler , and this is where i told a big lie .
so that could be a problem .
so that &apos;s certainly part of it .
and this is what we &apos;re doing .
now we have none of those , ok ?
the dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn &apos;t it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight ?
the games buttons are missing , but it &apos;ll also be a games machine , book machine .
we &apos;re coming in probably at 135 , to start , then drift down .
the only criticism , and people really don &apos;t want to criticize this , because it is a humanitarian effort ; it is a nonprofit effort ; and to criticize it is a little bit stupid , actually .
and the reason is that tool use , in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years , everything has been a physical modification of self .
and he said , &quot; that is the shortest distance between two points . &quot;
so we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
i want you to take a trip with me .
in resource-rich countries , with all the tests and treatment we currently have , less than two percent of babies are born hiv-positive -- 98 percent of babies are born hiv-negative .
meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
we view mothers as a community &apos;s single greatest resource .
and the third , and maybe the most grand , is to find ways to empower women , enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with hiv .
and so the mentor mother went along with .
and so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs , the side effects .
past patients taking care of present patients .
you can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush .
is it something we &apos;ve invented recently in the west ? &quot;
now , i was thrilled about this , because at school , there was a bully named kevin , and he was picking on me because i was the only jewish kid in class .
now , one day , i got a call out of the blue from a student , who asked a very simple but profound question .
she said , when she was just about to walk on stage , the tele-directors were still trying to agree on what to do , and so she just walked on stage and did what felt most natural .
here &apos;s four times the speed of the human .
africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories , and so what i have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories , stories about heroes of heart .
where he had learned to do that out in the bush i have no idea , but he could do it .
it pulls me . it turns . i throw my hand up . i &apos;m able to grab a branch .
now — now i don &apos;t know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you , but for solly , it was as natural as breathing .
the rest of the herd turned and began to follow .
anywhere he went , things went well .
you know , i never really believed in legacy . what am i going to leave behind ? i &apos;m an artist .
and i rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory , you know ? and if technology is not a metaphor for memory , what is it ?
i keep saying , &quot; nets , you live in the past while i &apos;ll create the future , and when i &apos;m done , you can study about it . &quot;
shukran !
conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow .
i try to share this everywhere i go .
but after three trips to antarctica , i decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water .
but i was in for the adventure .
and that &apos;s the area again .
the president of the maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries .
i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued , and it turned out there were none .
it &apos;s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
i &apos;ve just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle , the phoenix islands , but every other green patch on that has its own story .
throughout all of history , if you wanted something written , a report or an article , you had to involve a person .
you conclude , actually , that none of these things have mattered very much .
our digital -- our technologies are great gifts , and we , right now , have the great good fortune to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing , when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world .
and i &apos;ll just give you one example . i had gotten my first walkman .
then , under &quot; desire , &quot; they showed these shunsho paintings -- also from the edo period -- ink on silk .
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
you know , one is : just working without pressure .
again , it &apos;s the same thing -- &quot; guts &quot; is just the same room , reworked .
at the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly , the happy extreme , are the new guinea farming societies where i &apos;ve been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years , and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world .
there are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the u.s .
conversely , i at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
paradoxically nowadays , when we have more elderly people than ever before , living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before , old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before .
superman &apos;s parents die on krypton before the age of one .
so 33 of the stones are smuggled onto the nina , the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world .
and the last point about the 99 noor stones is this .
so al-batina is hidden , but she &apos;s a superhero .
that &apos;s not timely .
dr. razem : it &apos;s time to go , miklos .
but that &apos;s only half the story .
you can tell by the glasses there .
and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that , and that &apos;s using our eyes more .
and the recent financial crisis , how much of this diagram might that figure take up ?
as you can see , there &apos;s a kind of odd , regular pattern in the data , twin peaks every year .
what rises twice a year , once in easter and then two weeks before christmas , has a mini peak every monday , and then flattens out over the summer ?
it &apos;s almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me .
so we can use this new kind of language , if you like , to alter our perspective or change our views .
china drops to 124th .
and once you &apos;ve curated that data , and once you &apos;ve cleaned that data , and once it &apos;s there , you can do cool stuff like this .
so , just to wrap up , i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions , and information design is about solving information problems .
and after that , the complete fragrance .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
this is cis-3-hexene-1-ol . it smells of cut grass .
the bad news is they &apos;re rocket fuels .
in other words , i &apos;ve taken off-the-shelf components , and i &apos;ve made a spectroscope .
you see , when you &apos;re a scientist , you &apos;re always selling ideas .
and many people might need help in computation .
we see all this complexity .
you were separated from your family by the state .
i was a sign from god , they said .
it &apos;s not that i &apos;d had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away .
in the imagination i saw the endless possibility of life , the endless truth , the permanent creation of reality , the place where anger was an expression in the search for love , a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth .
and that &apos;s an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern kenya , looking for fossils .
so , let &apos;s go to lake turkana , which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country , kenya .
essentially , his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved .
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
i should point out at this time -- i &apos;m not a sculptor ; i &apos;m a hard-edged model maker .
and so i went back and looked through my &quot; creative projects &quot; folder , and i happened across the maltese falcon .
oh , finishing up with triple-zero steel wool .
yeah , i know !
and i got up off the seat of my bike , and i started pumping my legs , and as i sucked in the cold mountain air , i could feel it burning my lungs , and i looked up to see the sun shining in my face .
&quot; no . that body is broken . it can no longer serve me . &quot;
i tried to grasp what she was saying .
i felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
i knew it would be challenging , but it was actually a blessing , because maria always smiled .
i said , &quot; well , i have to get a friend to drive me out because i can &apos;t drive . sort of can &apos;t walk either .
and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun .
the philosopher lao tzu once said , &quot; when you let go of what you are , you become what you might be . &quot;
so i am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with .
when i do make some money , i &apos;ll have one machined for myself .
it comes back to instinct .
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by bernhardt , usa .
it contributes immensely to our sense of being , our sense of relationships with things , our sensuality and , you know , the sort of -- even the sort of socio-erotic side , which is very important .
this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry , who build parts for bentleys and so on .
cars are all wrong .
i &apos;m not putting charles eames &apos; furniture in buildings anymore .
it &apos;s next to david hockney &apos;s original studio .
there &apos;s an aerated brick i did in limoges last year , in concepts for new ceramics in architecture .
it was an evening dive .
and we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land , and do nearest neighbor distances .
this is another one of my favorite fish .
a lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud .
i &apos;ve made hundreds of dives in submersibles .
we &apos;re at the edge of the brine pool , there &apos;s a fish that &apos;s swimming towards the camera .
and we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
and this is what i saw when i looked out of the window .
as you probably know , in science , when you write a kind of special paper , only six or seven people read it .
in the first place , people started to send me all kinds of duck-related things , and i got a real nice collection .
this is mad max , a blackbird who lives in rotterdam .
for example , this is the sound of grass .
so imagine a restaurant where we can have , like , lady gaga salads as starters . i mean , this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables , probably .
and i like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels , and then i ask people , &quot; which one do you prefer ? &quot;
it &apos;s a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers .
this is a doctor , whose life is caring for people .
so , let &apos;s pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above .
they &apos;re threatened with a legal claim .
because it gives us the worst of both worlds : it &apos;s random -- anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury , not even an effort at consistency -- and it &apos;s also too detailed .
isaiah berlin put it this way : &quot; law sets frontiers , not artificially drawn , within which men shall be inviolable . &quot;
we have to rehumanize the law .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happened to america . look around .
more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent , uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with .
so what do they do ?
he was supporting his wife and a child , and the child was going to parochial school .
the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years .
first , they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity .
more hopeful are people we call system-changers .
well , one reason is that judge russell has now seen 108 vets in his veterans &apos; court as of february of this year , and out of 108 , guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison .
they want to have permission to do the right thing .
but i want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 -- going forward , of course -- were part of the arsenals of the united states and the soviet union .
this was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war , then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover .
so organizations like physicians for social responsibility , around 1979 , started saying this a lot publicly .
this is not a product placement . it &apos;s just -- in fact , if i was coca cola , i &apos;d be pretty distressed about this -- -- but basically , this is it .
the fourth element is that the high-value u.s. targets are accessible , soft and plentiful .
this is a 10-kiloton bomb , slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima . and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information . i think -- &quot; news you could use &quot; kind of concept here .
they are paralyzed .
we &apos;ve not been focused , we &apos;ve not done what we had to do , and now we &apos;re facing the potential of bad , hell on earth .
so this perspective is perhaps justified .
we &apos;re helping . we &apos;re doing better . we &apos;re doing good .
business generates those resources when it makes a profit .
it &apos;s too expensive to have a safe working environment , therefore business makes more money if they don &apos;t have a safe working environment .
we could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity .
and government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way .
you can see some internal organs .
i &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
the british association for the advancement of science is holding its third meeting at the university of cambridge .
richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx .
in the days before pocket calculators , the numbers that most professionals needed -- bankers , insurance agents , ship captains , engineers — were to be found in lookup books like this , filled with tables of figures .
eventually , the royal society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit , and this has become -- fortunately it &apos;s become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today .
i wasn &apos;t really a rocket scientist , but i was working at the jet propulsion laboratory in sunny california where it &apos;s warm ; whereas now i &apos;m in the mid-west , and it &apos;s cold .
except , if you look a little bit closer , you see , in fact , that this thing is way too small to be anything like that .
but the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that , if you look at the rate at which the infection worked , they show this spiky behavior that you &apos;re used to from a flu virus .
and all different strains are colored in different colors .
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
and it is detectable not just in amino acids .
now the viability threshold is reached , and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and , in fact , stabilizes .
and the guy says , &quot; no , no , actually i lost them down at the other end of the street , but the light is better here . &quot;
the only thing anyone was trying to find out is what percentage of zambian children are vaccinated , and this is the data , collected on paper over weeks from a single district , which is something like a county in the united states .
i was working in the centers for disease control , and i had a lot more hair back then as well .
the point is that anything , any system that depends on a single human being or two or three or five human beings , it just doesn &apos;t scale .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did .
so i told you before that when we were doing it the old-fashioned way , i realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket -- 10 , 20 , 30 different programs .
changing altitude , in life , that means raising to another psychological , philosophical , spiritual level .
this can be in environment , in finance , in education of children .
this is why you need people with long-term vision .
i had no idea how it was possible .
for that , unfortunately , four meters wingspan is not enough .
the goal is to take off , end of this year for the first test , but mainly next year , spring or summer , take off , on our own power , without additional help , without being towed , climb to 9,000 meters altitude .
you can just go on solarimpulse.com , subscribe to just be informed of what we &apos;re doing .
if you wanted to make a film , you needed a mass of equipment and a hollywood budget .
big skies , big hearts , big , shining continent .
because this is not all about charity .
does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain ?
in certain quarters of the world , brand eu , brand usa , is not at its shiniest .
a whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this .
but for the first time in history , we have the technology ; we have the know-how ; we have the cash ; we have the life-saving drugs .
they started out with such promise on africa .
artists , politicians , pop stars , priests , ceos , ngos , mothers &apos; unions , student unions .
we know there &apos;s more than enough energy to power this movement .
the problem is enormous .
but it didn &apos;t start out that way .
she is not she , but a buttercup .
if you are like 98 percent of other people , you will identify the round , amoeboid shape as bouba , and the sharp , spiky one as kiki .
sadly , it &apos;s metaphorically true .
and the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former .
and i would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in yemen .
so let &apos;s talk about the personal story for a moment .
n but it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society .
n as you know , the image of a lot of yemeni women is a lot of black and covered , veiled women .
we had some court cases .
you spoke about the responsibility of the press .
physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition , and usually after two to five years , you die .
if you go through a metal detector , you &apos;ll probably die .
i canceled most of my engagements that summer , but i had one left in tel aviv , so i went .
he said , &quot; be happy .
an infection ravaged my skin .
and i &apos;d like to thank my pianist , monica lee .
so a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes , premature puberty .
and so i find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it , we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment .
but it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals , the placenta , cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we &apos;re generating new chemicals that it &apos;s never seen before .
help me .
we turn on the faucet , the water comes out , we assume it &apos;s safe , and we assume that we are masters of our environment , rather than being part of it .
and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
i got plenty of takers .
we simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
the largest individuals of this species , the dreadnoughts of their kind , live just on the north coast of california , where the rain is really intense .
i became very interested , and i wrote about a couple .
we had been visited in the night by flying squirrels , who don &apos;t seem to recognize humans for what they are because they &apos;ve never seen them in the canopy before .
a redwood is a fractal . and as they put out limbs , the limbs burst into small trees , copies of the redwood .
the scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees .
one of the things that is just -- i almost can &apos;t conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn &apos;t picked this up at all , and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in north america .
richard preston , thank you very much , i think .
the pc virus problem is 25 years old now .
and you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
and that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
now i &apos;m not a lawyer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , &quot; i rest my case . &quot;
so preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
i &apos;m not engaged in predicting random number generators .
but let &apos;s face it , the secretary of state doesn &apos;t know much about iran .
so i &apos;m going to show you a factoid .
and everybody &apos;s best friend , ahmadinejad . how are things going for him ?
these guys are all shrinking , the power is all drifting out here , so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel .
it would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement , and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time .
and we do this every time that a video is uploaded to youtube .
and they &apos;ve ended up on a bunch of talk shows , and they &apos;ve used it as an opportunity to make a difference .
margaret gould stewart : how youtube thinks about copyright
it will sometimes be a lonely road .
now science may dismiss this methodology , but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .
and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way .
or are you running the same pattern ? because i believe that the invisible force of internal drive , activated , is the most important thing in the world .
whether it be your business , your contribution to society , money -- whatever it is for you -- your body , your family .
supreme court .
is this the end or the beginning ? is god punishing me or rewarding me , or is this the roll of the dice ?
right ? it wasn &apos;t your ability ; it was your state .
we need variety . we need surprise .
now , these first four needs , every human finds a way to meet .
i &apos;d say one of the parts of the map is like time . some people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years . somebody else &apos;s is three seconds , which is what i have .
it &apos;s the only way our world &apos;s going to change . god bless you .
i do this because i think that people actually have a lot in common .
and sad , negative feelings are darkly colored .
these are automatically constructed using the found objects : &quot; i think i feel a little full . &quot;
you can see the little pink cursor moving along , representing our position .
you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted .
and it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky .
in universe , there &apos;s kind of no end . it just goes infinitely , and you can just kind of click on stuff .
the superstars of climate change in 2006 : united states , britain , china . you know , these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept .
they think of them as the annoying , frustrating obstructions , and then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking .
and all these photographs that i &apos;m showing , they were sent in by members .
you just need to step outside , pay attention to what &apos;s so commonplace , so everyday , so mundane that everybody else misses it .
so keep looking up , marvel at the ephemeral beauty , and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds .
they would put up 25,000 images , they would go like this , &quot; 25,0000 , okay , okay .
and you know , going back maybe 10 years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine .
so this is from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see that knife went through the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has very , very fast step motors inside of the pen .
now this is really an interesting project .
so he &apos;s going like this .
so , some very talented people .
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world .
so it &apos;s not the final story , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
as i pursued my career , something was always gnawing away inside me .
and in 2001 , i took a research leave to visit them .
and we got lots of applicants .
so here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004 .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
each will have a pan-african student body , but specialize in a different area of science .
i got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up in accra , and it was a really cool device .
he studies the brain using mri , and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned .
and i &apos;ll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .
transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really benefitted from that .
the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
kwabena boahen : yes , like i said at the beginning , i got my first computer when i was a teenager , growing up in accra .
and i &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
so , if i were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the university of oxford , it would become a black hole .
now , there are a few relatively exotic galaxies .
now , the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away .
so , i &apos;ve spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere , to give us a cleaner view .
you can see a lot of stars .
it strips that gas cloud apart .
so , in conclusion , i &apos;m going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving , in three dimensions .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascinates me .
and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries , as have our preferences for them .
and every musical era had different priorities of these things , different things to pass on , different &apos; whats &apos; and &apos; hows &apos; .
and the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the scores , the codebooks of music , into the hands of performers everywhere .
nobody knows .
all that &apos; what &apos; , all that &apos; how &apos; is out there waiting for you to discover its &apos; why &apos; , to dive in and pass it on .
the majority of it is in the higher altitudes , above 300 feet , where we don &apos;t have a technology as yet to get there .
prior to world war ii , they were making 1000 planes a year .
well , because mr. anderson told me that this session is called &quot; sync and flow , &quot; i was wondering , &quot; what do i know that these geniuses don &apos;t ? &quot;
instead , i &apos;d like to try something called &quot; improvisation . &quot;
now , the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet .
what is going on here ?
that &apos;s a lot of light .
we are learning from them .
it packs a huge amount of data , and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it .
well , so , there &apos;s some showing as well as telling .
i mean , the world &apos;s universities are opening up their curricula .
i mean , is it crazy to think that this girl , in the back , at the right , in 15 years , might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren ?
and thank you .
i &apos;ll give you three examples .
now i hope you enjoy the session .
if you want to compare oranges to windshields , what do you do ?
it engages deep systems in our brain , in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex , food and salt .
we &apos;re so good at this we don &apos;t really even notice it .
there was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians .
now , here is king cnut , king a thousand years ago .
so , how could this happen ?
why ? it cuts fuel poverty , it cuts their bills , and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player .
now , out of all the places that do better than the u.s. in reading , how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve ?
so it tells us we &apos;re asking the right questions .
i think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan , things you cannot convey in a standard , things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy .
it &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist .
let me take you on a little tour .
but like diybio , the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk .
it just has to follow safety guidelines .
now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with hiv .
unfortunately , these good laws of really bad law -- law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation , laws which specifically punish people living with hiv or those at greatest risk .
the nurse said to me , &quot; why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are hiv positive ?
they &apos;re at high risk of hiv through contaminated injection equipment and other risk-related behaviors .
one of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground .
it was the center of entertainment , of energy production , of work , the center of health care .
first of all , work is becoming distributed and mobile .
this is even a more interesting solution in seoul , korea .
developers say , okay , we &apos;ll build little teeny apartments .
this can be combined with led lighting as well .
a third of the size of the basking shark is their liver , and it &apos;s full of oil .
and it declined very fast -- a classic boom and bust fishery , which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there &apos;s low reproductive rates .
in fact , they have no legislative status in ireland whatsoever , despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside .
and of course , sharks , fish , are underwater most of the time .
i think this means basically that they &apos;re all sharks and they &apos;ve come from a common ancestry .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; that &apos;s just ridiculous . no way . &quot;
now when we were out tagging our sharks , this is how we tagged them on the front of a rib -- get in there fast -- occasionally the sharks do react .
it became known as simon &apos;s shark slime .
so you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark .
as a young reporter , i thought that i should do it in a different way , so that it has a maximum impact , since everybody knew that it was happening , and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system .
i &apos;m sure most of you may have heard , in tanzania , children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society .
the next moment , you see the money in my hands , counting , whereas i have not come into contact with anybody .
evil in the society is an extreme disease .
and we &apos;re appreciative . we salute you . thank you so much , anas .
i grew up in a very sheltered environment .
i felt like i was performing this elaborate act .
were we even a group ? what group ?
the fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
it wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
and seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
and that tells us several things .
i had access to him . i could study him , have him come to my home , get to know him , do psychological analysis to see , was he a good apple or bad apple .
so how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character , if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon ?
there &apos;s a study some of you think you know about , but very few people have ever read the story . you watched the movie .
you &apos;re a good person . you complain .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
they &apos;re going to become numbers .
mindlessly taking the first small step .
and since the inquisition , we &apos;ve been dealing with problems at the individual level . and you know what ? it doesn &apos;t work .
they &apos;re not prisoners , they &apos;re not guards , they &apos;re boys , and you are responsible . &quot;
a half an inch would have taken his head off .
so much for the wonder , now for the mystery .
we are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images .
you see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins .
and so that is a beginning .
so now i &apos;m going to show you a picture .
the autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made ; it &apos;s the lived past and the anticipated future .
i was raised on &quot; free to be you and me &quot; -- hip-hop -- not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house .
i decided , okay , i can claim the feminist label .
i say , &quot; samhita mukhopadhyay , miriam perez , ann friedman , jessica valenti , vanessa valenti , and on and on and on and on . &quot;
there &apos;s a writer i &apos;ve been deeply influenced by , parker palmer , and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed &quot; between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves . &quot;
i was listening to her talk on the phone , which she did a lot .
if you think about it , this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species , isn &apos;t it ?
you may or may not have noticed that i &apos;m wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead .
we were transcending the space between the mind and the device .
so you use it with your headset .
perhaps even more importantly , thought-controlled computing can give children with add insights into their own fluctuating mental states , so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs .
they knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase , when you come into contact with yourself .
and on my seventeenth birthday , after my fake eye exam , the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday .
no limitations .
wonderfully , my eyes decided , enough .
but before i got to him , i was so lost .
but i did know the game was up .
do something different . what do you want to be ?
the most powerful thing of all , it &apos;s not that i didn &apos;t achieve before then . oh my god , i did .
he said , &quot; be you . &quot;
if you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette , you &apos;re a fucking philosopher .
it &apos;s an interesting question .
you know my example of the eurostar .
the accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights ; it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights .
this is a toll crossing in britain .
praxeology is the study of human choice , action and decision making .
the effort to do that almost broke the organization .
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school .
three , two , one , go !
that &apos;s the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost , gets unpublished , is left missing in action , and they say the results described here &quot; might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead . &quot;
this is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine .
this is a disaster .
we &apos;ll fly outside it here , just to see this sort of containment .
we carry that in us .
music can change your life , more than almost anything .
i think that &apos;s true for many of us , and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have , from ourselves to the outside world .
this is by far the farthest he &apos;s strayed from tewksbury hospital , i can tell you that , because he &apos;s motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music .
tm : so let &apos;s do it . so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you &apos;re going to play now ?
so this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song .
because there &apos;s two heads inside one person when you think about it .
i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were .
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
but aren &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
and as you get to the very bottom , you &apos;re faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don &apos;t save anything for retirement , you won &apos;t be able to afford any housing at all .
the older face is quite pleased with the decision .
about six years ago i decided that i would learn arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language .
but now we have the answer to our question .
and yet , even in the best-resourced countries , for example here in europe , roughly 50 percent of affected people don &apos;t receive these interventions .
but equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it &apos;s become very remote and removed from local communities .
this came out in 2008 , which was , of course , around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars .
that genetic material probably belonged , if it could belong to anyone , to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule , which then became the medicine .
the reason this is happening boils down , in my mind , to one basic problem , which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .
in fact , this was what really inspired my interest in this phase .
he &apos;s basically worked the cost to puma .
more of that in a minute .
and i &apos;m going to tell you the richard feynman that i knew .
and in fact , we did sometimes do physics together .
and they were full of all kinds of jargon .
i think it may have been a special rapport that he and i had .
and feynman &apos;s eyes just opened up .
but he also deeply believed , he truly believed , that if you couldn &apos;t explain something simply you didn &apos;t understand it .
incidentally , i &apos;ll tell you what that super-powerful technique was .
what do you see ?
that seemed really like a crisis to me , that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape , and about travel , and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell .
it &apos;s got a huge couch , fits quite a few people , and basically we &apos;d had a great time with this .
so we build a lot of things .
and you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory .
number four -- deconstruct appliances .
and it &apos;s fun for the whole family .
and then for that unstable ligament , we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee .
it &apos;s by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it , and then we can put it back into a patient &apos;s knee .
this is an example of a real meteorite , and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth , and just how much of it survives and melts .
they got you out of purgatory faster .
there is a glass bridge that you walk across that &apos;s suspended in space .
and i &apos;ll give you a quick example .
and i say , what is the light bulb good for ?
but they want to use it -- seriously .
we &apos;re also working on noise canceling things like snoring , noise from automobiles .
i said we can shorten the column , we can spread it out to cover the couch .
looked up at the ceiling of my office one day -- i was working on a ground-penetrating radar project -- and my physicist ceo came in and said , &quot; we have a real problem .
yeah , there you go .
so i have a particular imaginative approach to visual work .
and then i used it again to create six pieces for stefan &apos;s book , &quot; things in my life i &apos;ve learned so far . &quot;
but in 2007 , i got the cockamamie idea to hand-draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list .
impossible ? i don &apos;t think so .
and this isn &apos;t something that you can quantify or track or measure , and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can &apos;t measure .
let &apos;s play a little .
thank you .
so when we think about future technologies , we actually think of using bacteria and virus , simple organisms .
and i absolutely love the periodic table .
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical , but they differ from each other based on their tips , on one sequence that codes for one protein .
my students promised me it would work .
however , if you actually talk to people and even question yourself , and you ask yourself , where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done ?
you look back on your day , and you &apos;re like , i got nothing done today .
if you &apos;re interrupted and woken up , you have to start again .
you decide when you want to turn something on .
but what &apos;s even worse is the thing that managers do most of all , which is call meetings .
you can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour .
and if you try that , i think you &apos;ll find that you agree .
i live and work from tokyo , japan .
and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff .
you don &apos;t need to ask permission from anyone , you can just go ahead and do it , right ?
and apart from things like entertainment , you wouldn &apos;t pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf , or , at least , not yet .
and i read out that number to them , and they use it to top up their phone .
and it &apos;s all about the social network of the knowledge , floating around .
you can see the chai being poured in the background .
what i wanted to talk to you about today is two things : one , the rise of a culture of availability ; and two , a request .
look around you .
some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blueberries , alcohol in moderation , stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana .
thank you .
this idea is nicely captured by this quote : &quot; things without all remedy should be without regard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot;
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways .
make it go away . make it go away . &quot;
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences , either for our own or for other people &apos;s health and happiness and livelihoods , and in the very worst case scenario , even their lives .
when other people see my tattoo , for the most part they like how it looks .
kathryn schulz : don &apos;t regret regret
when i became president in 1993 , there were none of these organizations in russia .
we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
and they &apos;ve achieved a lot of other amazing health results .
within the first 18 months , the following things happened : we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for aids .
we have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation , reorganize itself , focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive , quality health care with minimal outside help .
the classrooms have no walls .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
this was a great thing .
this young man is picking organic vegetables .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
is this doable in your community ?
chaz ebert : it was chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak .
this was faster , and nobody had to try to read my handwriting .
all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth .
but i &apos;ve got to say , in first grade , they said i talked too much , and now i still can .
the programmers said it could assist students in their learning .
we are born into a box of time and space .
believe me , he didn &apos;t mean this as -- anyway , let me just read it .
the guy says , &quot; i want a second opinion . &quot;
they were run by an inexperienced staff , with no visual culture , no budgets for visuals -- in many places there were not even art directors .
and design is responsible for this experience .
why am i asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
so as part of organizing this and whatever , this commemoration , the police will round us up as they call us leaders .
your aorta comes up behind your heart .
so eventually , the hospital decided it was time for me to go .
and then they had to figure out : &quot; well she needs furniture .
so close your eyes .
but when you &apos;re blind , you have the tactile memory for things .
now , symmetry is almost nature &apos;s language .
but what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them .
the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions .
now , for galois , there was actually a sixth symmetry .
but let &apos;s go back down to symmetries that i got for these two objects .
and you can try this when you go down to the pub , later on .
and the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars .
how many symmetries does a rubik &apos;s cube have ?
it actually has -- the number of symmetries in the rubik &apos;s cube has 25 digits .
and i could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity , at least in the next few hundred years .
we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what &apos;s going on .
it could benefit from tragedies .
they have combined the list of major innovations , and they &apos;ve discovered that the greatest number , the greatest decade , for fundamental innovations , as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- was the great depression .
and we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge , to share their knowledge , in the face of an emergency , which they hadn &apos;t really been for years and years .
also on the web , when the text is too small , what you do is hold down the control key and hit plus , plus , plus .
double click the word . watch 200 . i go double click .
i mean it &apos;s point and click , it &apos;s like the menus , icons , it &apos;s all the kind of same thing .
so , one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that , you know , &quot; okay , well my real desk is really messy . i don &apos;t want that mess on my computer . &quot;
thank you .
and this is art . this is metaphor .
and i said , &quot; how does that work ? &quot;
you can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them .
this isn &apos;t information .
and how far can you take that ? how far can you take it ?
we &apos;ll actually part the water to pull money out of the air , because it &apos;s a bright future if you &apos;re an algorithm .
the key , two words : this half of the room , your word is &quot; shake . &quot;
it &apos;s way too big a towel .
so , traffic keeps flowing , so that means less braking , which means less accelerating , less gas and less pollution , less time wasted , and that partly accounts for europe &apos;s better efficiency than we have in the united states .
because it is saving lives . so , is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?
i wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation , sharing some of the problems .
it &apos;s been a severe disease for thousands of years .
over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it .
so we &apos;re going to have these new tools .
now , the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis , but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting .
and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .
the second is giving extra money to people who get their master &apos;s degree .
i thought , &quot; i &apos;m in the sports rally or something .
if you have a kid who &apos;s behind , you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do , sometimes pushing into what they can &apos;t do , helps them focus on finding their own voice .
jb : he did . he pulled in every favor he could , and got a pass into the world trade center site , where he photographed for nine months almost every day .
and then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier .
you &apos;re just one of the people who hasn &apos;t been told .
and then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in america .
and we wait .
and the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors -- for example , the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make .
women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes .
and what i &apos;m talking about are nerves .
we &apos;ve been able to see every single nerve .
we &apos;re focused on adding drugs , adding growth factors , killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue .
it &apos;s called the basket cell .
but electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
so this turned out to be very simple to do .
these are the dopamine neurons , which some of you may have heard about , in some of the pleasure centers in the brain .
and the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
so it &apos;s early days , to be upfront , but we &apos;re excited about it .
so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus .
what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?
so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another .
and so i went out .
no single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood .
and he &apos;s tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs , and so you have kind of an authority -- a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it .
so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain , that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream -- the question is , are you finding out something new ?
so the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s -- slaves , emancipation , slavery , rebellion , kansas .
if you &apos;re the first site there , everybody links to you .
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king .
in a filmclub season about democracy and government , we screened &quot; mr. smith goes to washington . &quot;
what would they do under the same conditions ?
as one 12-year-old said after watching &quot; wizard of oz , &quot; &quot; every person should watch this , because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart . &quot;
well , in my world , this is a rubber duck .
so if you don &apos;t have an endgame of something delightful , then you &apos;re just moving chess pieces around , if you don &apos;t know you &apos;re taking the king .
and if we remember sheikh yamani when he formed opec , they asked him , &quot; when will we see the end of the age of oil ? &quot;
if we look at the world of architecture , we see with mies &apos; 1928 tower for berlin , the question might be , &quot; well , where &apos;s the sun ? &quot;
we &apos;re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
using those intellectual filters , we eliminated &#91; 7,962 . &#93; we were left with 38 chemicals .
they showed up in five days .
we lay out the building areas .
we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
they &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
they even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
let &apos;s take , for example , sweden .
feel free to survey me if that helps .
she was one of the targets of nsa surveillance .
so let &apos;s take a look at the brain .
it &apos;s one continuous processing unit , if you will .
they &apos;re encoded in the dna .
and then what we get is our first mapping .
we take that tissue , we purify the rna out of it using some basic technology , and then we put a florescent tag on it .
and remember that we &apos;ve assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome and have all of that data available .
and so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they &apos;re great . they analyze large populations .
it &apos;s this dark purple precipitate within the cell that &apos;s telling us a gene is turned on there .
do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money ?
we don &apos;t know .
do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage , or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ?
so you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals .
so what do we find ?
we can just run an experiment .
there are so many things you could do . you could pay for uniforms , you could eliminate fees , you could build latrines , you could give girls sanitary pads , etc . , etc .
so this is not your intuition , this is not what people would have gone for , and yet , these are the programs that work .
so we cannot eradicate poverty just yet , but we can get started .
esther duflo : social experiments to fight poverty
to go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you .
and the siwa oasis is famous for several things , but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him .
africa is home to over 1,000 languages -- 2,000 is another estimate that &apos;s out there -- with over 2,000 languages and dialects .
and this is what today is about -- it &apos;s about discussing those very opportunities .
what &apos;s going on in nigeria ? a couple of things .
what &apos;s going on there ?
let &apos;s look at the stock markets in africa .
this time &#91; i &apos;ll &#93; give you the entire picture that i saw in 2002 , and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in africa , think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent .
it creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard . and &quot; god &quot; ?
open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization gives to us .
and , i guess somebody thought they needed to do that .
so this is the footage he photographed , and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring .
&quot; and the thing without the wheels , that moves . &quot;
now about half the audience has their left hand up . why is that ?
kb : no , but you &apos;re ok , yes ?
kb : sure there &apos;s not ?
now , most people here would automatically say no . ok , but i want you to realize some facts .
is it a girl ?
nicole : a touch on my back .
now , what i want you to do is look directly at me , ok , just take a deep breath in through your nose , letting it out through your mouth , and relax .
imagine a connection between you and him .
it &apos;s nearly impossible to break a coke bottle .
stare at the glass , ignore everybody right here .
thank you .
ok , and tell me when you &apos;re done .
ok , go ahead , mix them up .
sj : yes , there &apos;s one .
keith barry : brain magic
so i took to my bed for about a month , and when i woke up i found i was institutionalized , and when i saw the other inmates , i realized that i had found my people , my tribe .
but i got a little bad news for you folks . i got some bad news .
as an altar boy , i breathed in a lot of incense , and i learned to say phrases in latin , but i also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s top-down morality applied to everybody .
first of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule .
now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person &apos;s account .
using the oxytocin inhaler , we ran more studies .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
i have this job interview in galena in 15 minutes , and i need this job , i &apos;ve got to go . &quot;
there &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting -- through the action of testosterone .
then the groom &apos;s father , then the groom , then the family , then the friends -- arrayed around the bride like planets around the sun .
so oxytocin connects us to other people .
it &apos;s still with us today .
and i used to think , how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
and they said something very interesting to me .
where does it stop ?
i got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a decade ahead of their time .
what &apos;s learning going to be like ? we know what it &apos;s like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand .
what happens to creativity in our age ?
the teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens .
so here are a couple of images from soles .
that &apos;s my wish .
and it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off .
this is shivdutt yadav , and he &apos;s from uttar pradesh , india .
and it &apos;s meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet , in a less linear form .
polygamy is widely practiced in kenya .
she is followed by her four children , all of whom were killed in the srebrenica massacre .
another section of the family presented their clothing , as opposed to their physical presence , because they didn &apos;t want to be identified with the past that i was highlighting .
in a 12-month period when i was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
but anyway , it &apos;s just great to see such a full theater , and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .
so there , we experience the translation . now we &apos;ll experience the interpretation .
and he said , &quot; well , how are you going to hear this ? how are you going to hear that ? &quot;
i have the sound coming this way .
we just -- we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
see , you &apos;re awake .
and so on and so forth . what does this piece require ?
evelyn glennie : how to truly listen
somebody says they &apos;re linking to something interesting , and you get an &apos; 80s pop song . that &apos;s all it was .
i ended up at this really fancy party .
got a couple questions for you .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
and they were probably pleased to see you on top of the time poll .
fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size .
that is 10 times larger than the mammal radiation , which was a four-legged radiation .
we &apos;re talking about ethiopia , but let &apos;s talk about niger -- or niger , in our english language -- north of nigeria -- that &apos;s where this photograph was taken .
the crocodile is technically called sarcosuchus .
paul has his data , so they decide to release the animal back into the river .
these are all landlubbing animals . there &apos;s a couple of choices .
i became an artist . o.k. , and started drawing .
and the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science .
except -- bad news for derartu tulu -- some other people had the same idea , including the olympic gold medalist and paula radcliffe , who is a monster , the fastest woman marathoner in history by far .
you show me a creature with webbed feet and gills ; somehow water &apos;s involved .
now we &apos;re not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle .
well emily baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place , in the top 10 , even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet , beat 492 other people .
that &apos;s all we could do .
but maybe it &apos;s something different .
stop focusing on urban marathons , which , if you do four hours , you suck .
robotics had really been about interacting with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
the remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and through this technology , being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren &apos;s lives in a way that &apos;s not possible today .
and the third was just a pen and paper log , because that &apos;s the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
i &apos;m stylin &apos; , smilin &apos; , lookin &apos; real mean , because it ain &apos;t about being heard , just being seen .
took off fast , didn &apos;t get far . i fired , &apos; pow ! &apos; fool fell between two parked cars .
when he was writing a broadway show , i would be outside of the door .
i show a number of photographs and films , but i also make television programs , books and some advertising , all with the same concept .
so , the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ; what you can &apos;t have , you want more .
how they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing , and how that should happen .
it &apos;s highly commercial .
and then you change the photograph he &apos;s shooting at , and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible . .
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
easy to treat . look at the situation in mauritius .
but start telling them , you know , we &apos;re going to try to do it in nigeria -- everyone runs away .
it extends opportunity to the rural centers , and we can use expertise in a very smart way .
prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that .
and we are starting a biomedical engineering program , so that we will train people locally , who can repair that equipment .
autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal -- all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers .
in fact , i loved the movie , how they duplicated all my projects . that &apos;s the geek side .
now , one of the things i learned very early on because i wasn &apos;t that social , is i had to sell my work , and not myself .
now , another thing is the sensory issues .
in other words , categorize equipment problem from a people problem .
he was now dr. carlock in the movie .
i did internships in college , i was building things , and i also had to learn how to do assignments .
another thing that can be very , very , very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry , and they can teach your kid .
tg : i &apos;m passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place .
it &apos;s an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system , or a digital storytelling tool .
it &apos;s the fifth time i stand on this shore , the cuban shore , looking out at that distant horizon , believing , again , that i &apos;m going to make it all the way across that vast , dangerous wilderness of an ocean .
but it was deeper . it was , how much life is there left ?
and then we kind of have a cardinal rule that i &apos;m never told , really , how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but the truth is , all those orations that i had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation , it wasn &apos;t like that .
thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
and perhaps most tragically , he lost his self-worth .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation ?
they had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew . otherwise , you couldn &apos;t get the right kind of argument going .
but there was one programmer who decided that this wasn &apos;t the way to work .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn &apos;t know of each other &apos;s existence beforehand .
this is a called a &quot; diff , &quot; this thing on the right here .
a momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . right ?
don &apos;t try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing , because that doesn &apos;t get you very far .
and anyone who tells you you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t listen to them .
six to nine months at the right time of the year .
but we really made sure we tested those rovers before we got them down -- or that rover -- and made sure that it &apos;s all working well .
so we have a spacecraft which is heading towards mars , called phoenix , and that spacecraft will land 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds from now , so you can adjust your watch .
and that would be bad .
so we are in the process , as we speak , of actually designing the next rover that we are going to be sending to mars .
and i know many of you , kind of , last time afterwards said well , that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags .
well , there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .
so it &apos;s very much like the cycle on earth except because it &apos;s so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have frozen .
what i &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .
so let &apos;s see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .
and this is an example of this paradigm shift .
so imagine we already have wireless scales .
and i think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as augmented by these sorts of technologies .
but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
through websites like patients like me or managing your data on microsoft healthvault or google health , leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important .
we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack , we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
her cats , god knows how many , who must piss on her rugs -- her landing &apos;s a sickening reek .
her crossing the fragmented tiles , faltering at the step to the street , droning , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control , and i &apos;d be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench .
but i &apos;m afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me .
when we make love , her holding me everywhere all around me , i &apos;m there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something -- in other words , to act .
in the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i &apos;d read lots of books . i studied maps and charts .
i could see myself sticking the flag in a pole , you know -- ah , glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo .
finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all-clear , loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
i knew there was more open water . and i had a secret weapon up my sleeve .
i knew this , but i was expecting something .
this was the view outside my tent when i had this fateful phone call .
and only from the air did i see the big picture .
and they turned around , headed back to the coast , and all five of them died on the return journey .
this is coming from a jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
but a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?
one day in 1819 , 3,000 miles off the coast of chile , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean , 20 american sailors watched their ship flood with seawater .
but at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up .
they have the same architecture .
now , some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we put it in every sitting room in the arab world -- and internationally , globally , through our english channel .
they have been detached from their people , from the masses , and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other .
i thank you very much .
because we discovered that people care , and people would like to know -- they are receiving the stream through our internet .
and frankie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
so , these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states , and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them .
you can see these horrifying figures from africa .
now , am i saying , &quot; oh , well , great prevention strategy .
ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of jakarta ; she &apos;s a chick with a dick .
she was 105 years old when i took this picture .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
and play a little banjo . let &apos;s do a little medley .
we were driving in the car outside of gatesville , texas , where i grew up in the early part of my life .
and mom was just sitting by the car like this .
try this old song with me . i sing : well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
it was originally made by the dopyera brothers , who later on made the dobro , which is a wood-bodied instrument with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from .
oh yeah , that &apos;s easier said than done .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .
when drum machines were new , i got to thinking , why couldn &apos;t you take the oldest form of music , the hambone rhythms , and combine it with the newest technology ?
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .
it &apos;s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space , because that &apos;s defined , not with respect to say , where other things are , but with respect to this absolute notion of space , which for newton was god .
and in a relational universe the only possible explanation was , somehow it made itself .
and you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there &apos;s a continual jostling and give and take , which is politics .
there is a fellow tedster who spoke two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work into three different levels .
and then just leave it all to them .
he closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .
was not very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers , who all performed there , get their own casa da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
just a bit too ornamental .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead .
but the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased , and , by extension , the deceased &apos;s family .
if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life , we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear .
i was planning on finishing on a dance ...
her talk about the aquatic ape , and the link , of course , the link between darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -- we &apos;re not hirsute and we can swim rather well .
alright gordon , come on , eh .
&quot; and now it &apos;s got a hangover . &quot;
that &apos;s eight years of american history , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that .
and jack nicholson just says , &quot; you make me want to be a better man . &quot;
&quot; make this world a better place , if you can .
so i &apos;ll just give you my message up front : try not to go extinct .
where are all the little ones ? &quot;
so this is where people went astray again .
now as you can imagine , cutting open a leg bone is one thing , but when you go to a museum and say , &quot; you don &apos;t mind if i cut open your dinosaur &apos;s skull do you ? &quot;
and one would think , that should give me a clue .
so we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones .
so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grownup triceratops .
it looks like it could still get bigger .
and we wanted to use the water not only as a context , but as a primary building material .
the public , you know , once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar .
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn &apos;t belong together .
the building incorporates the site , but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed .
and one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity , expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible .
so what we wanted to do was produce this effect , this lighting effect , which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls .
case in point , this march , the new york times ran a story by james mckinley about a gang rape of a young girl , 11 years old , in a small texas town .
they tend to sensationalize , and they lack context .
this is its cover from november 15 , 2010 .
one of my board members is an editor at a major global media company , but she never thought about this as a career path until she met female role models at jaws .
and we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
madeleine albright : this is &quot; breaking the glass ceiling . &quot;
so that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping .
so i think that it behooves us -- those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -- that we need to help other women .
so for instance , what i did when i went to burundi , we &apos;d got tutsi and hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in rwanda .
and my motto is that there &apos;s a special place in hell for women who don &apos;t help each other .
look at the pictures these data sets print .
can &apos;t be true , can it ?
there is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder .
so i &apos;m here to -- i guess we &apos;re here to try and infect you with this virtuous , data-based virus , the one we call factivism .
i will say that life involves computation .
and as other things become easier to use -- maybe protein -- we &apos;ll work with those .
so , i &apos;m going to start asking those questions for the dna structures i &apos;m going to talk about next .
and what happens is that we mix these strands together .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami , a beautiful rendition of china , which even has taiwan , and you can see it &apos;s sort of on the world &apos;s shortest leash , right ?
it was started by erik winfree , and what it does , it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a dna origami .
so , this sort of recapitulates what i was telling you about development .
i want you to remember that to create life &apos;s very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that .
for those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea .
often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .
it never has been and it never will be .
but if it &apos;s a 3,000-rupee , 70-dollar bribe , what fee would you have to charge , and can you actually make the business work ?
let &apos;s see how it works in actual practice .
let &apos;s now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment , and look at all the talks together .
and apparently it smells like bacon .
this is a training ground where one group is taught to lead and the other is made to follow .
not one .
it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people .
but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing : &quot; we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure . &quot;
the lemonade story is one .
there was going to be a national referendum .
a few sources of hope : we ought to try to re-moralize work .
his employees are inspired by the effort .
the camera is always on .
barry schwartz : our loss of wisdom
either way they were going to eat it .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what . i &apos;ll build you an arm that &apos;s under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year .
now chuck is doing something quite extraordinary , at least for my limited physical skill .
&quot; well , would it help if i ... &quot;
and we saw lots of these kids , lots of them .
he doesn &apos;t really want a lot .
&quot; should we be there ?
great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
let &apos;s go there and make love . in the tent . &quot;
so , next i went to london .
and i stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop .
there is many different aspects to free-diving .
and this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath .
this was a critical mistake .
and what he did in response , is he went on regis and kelly , and broke his old record .
which was making me more nervous .
it was awful .
and that &apos;s my life . so ...
then connect the power . finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
so , as sort of — i &apos;m told it &apos;s called a stadium wave , so we &apos;re going to start from this side of the room on the count of three , and go over to here .
because , with our present knowledge , we have no idea what would happen .
so humans are turning more towards animal consumption .
let &apos;s look at one case , the case of bangladesh .
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west nile fever ?
we all felt that we were part of it , that a better world was right around the corner , that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice .
when you read the biblical plague of boils , that was smallpox .
whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities , all the way through modern medicine , we have changed our own evolution .
and so one of the things we &apos;ve been doing is using genetic enhancement , or genetic manipulation , of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics .
some of you may have read about the fda &apos;s consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon .
so really , what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon , but a guar with cow mitochondria , and therefore cow mitochondrial dna , and a mouflon with another species of sheep &apos;s mitochondrial dna .
the graduate students in sanjiv talwar &apos;s lab said , &quot; is this ethical ?
this is where we are in this process .
thanks .
if only darwin lived today .
this polymer is amazing because it &apos;s present in so many different organisms .
a remarkable , remarkable testament to the power of evolution .
how can we begin to understand it ?
take your skin color , and celebrate it .
now why do i show a cauliflower , a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ?
so then if you try to ask questions : &quot; what &apos;s the surface of a cauliflower ? &quot;
and i think that my mathematics , surprisingly enough , has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses , all these branching systems , for which there was no geometry .
and well , it &apos;s a story unto itself .
i measured it , 1.33 .
&quot; well , acts of god .
this comes out repeatedly , again , again , again .
the most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us .
in order to solve these puzzles effectively , if you think about it , your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously .
now , here &apos;s another example .
in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles .
you know , there &apos;s a small country nestled in the himalayan mountains , far from these beautiful mountains , where the people of the kingdom of bhutan have decided to do something different , which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product .
he comes to the market when prices are lowest , with the meager fruits of his hard labor , just after the harvest , because he has no choice .
i have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that , because of the absence of grades and standards and market information , sacks have to be constantly changed .
when conditions are right , we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural africa , just like anywhere else .
so , the ecx is an ethiopian exchange for ethiopia .
but it will create new opportunities .
the threat is desertification .
and yet desertification is a major threat on all continents , affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world &apos;s agricultural drylands .
trees or cacti are good for this .
i &apos;m not an economist , very much not , but i did , quite literally , a back of the envelope calculation -- -- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars .
the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century .
i had no practical skills .
we &apos;ve seen lots of excitement from these people , who can now start a construction business , parts manufacturing , organic csa or just selling power back to the grid .
fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .
the flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the british medical journal , and they were choosing over the pill , anesthesia , and surgery .
so these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in butare .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-law &apos;s house .
it &apos;s about 50 or so years off track .
the other thing it shows you is that , although there &apos;s this beautiful forest of coral , there are no fish in that picture .
cod fed most of the people of western europe .
what that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish .
that picture on the left is just staggering to me .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
sometimes you have a toxic bloom ; sometimes you don &apos;t .
and the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve , we should have some evidence of their existence by now .
and so i spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night , the sidewalk still warm from the sun , watching the skies for ufos .
i looked into their strangely angry faces , and i remember wondering , are they wearing rubber masks ?
that &apos;s when she turned to me and said , &quot; are you looking forward to seeing the movie ? &quot;
this image by ted joseph was from that book , and was his , sort of , police sketch of what the creatures looked like that whitley strieber had described to him .
our last day in portugal , we were in the district capital of faro , and catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time .
five young men -- all laughing , happy , traveling together , coming back to this hotel where they were staying .
and recession , of course , isn &apos;t exactly a recipe for hope either , as we &apos;re busy finding out .
so it looks a little bit like this .
the savings ratio , net savings , were below zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crash .
you can hear the five-year-old mind working .
and in the same token , the solution becomes clear , because this isn &apos;t , therefore , about changing human nature .
we have to invest , in fact , in the idea of a meaningful prosperity , providing capabilities for people to flourish .
first of all , economists aren &apos;t supposed to be inspiring , so you may need to work on the tone a little .
i painted it directly on top of the man .
it was about space and light .
this is a photograph from when i visited prudhoe bay in alaska in 2002 to watch the minerals management service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice .
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .
and that &apos;s actually very perverse .
and then , of course , there was john d. rockefeller .
it also put in place the national environmental policy act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business -- they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t actually want to be doing what they &apos;re doing .
if you look at people who make $ 50,000 a year , they have two kids , they might have three jobs or more , and then they have to really commute .
we need to kind of rationalize this whole thing , and you can find more about this policy .
well , you probably recognize the first person .
and here she relates , in the documentary film &quot; afghan star , &quot; how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole .
i feels like you &apos;ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time .
and there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt . everest .
blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
this is a state diagram . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
can we get self-replicating-type behavior ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape -- the b -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
this is three minutes of uv light .
and if you &apos;ve seen amy smith , she talks about how you get students at mit to work with communities in haiti .
and it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face .
increasingly , we &apos;re realizing that we don &apos;t even need to densify an entire city .
okay . i do too .
do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by , for example , connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration ?
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is .
because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is .
they like the generics .
if not , one or the other needs upgrading , isn &apos;t it ?
then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
and now i have income per person on this axis .
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great leap forward .
can you see how it &apos;s growing ? and how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in asia ?
and here were are . we have a continuum in the world .
look here . this is the world .
they get safe water , they get food for the poor , and they get malaria eradicated .
and we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world .
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it will not happen around one superpower .
a lot of you have heard the term &quot; memes . &quot; the evolution of technology , i pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand axe .
the argument i make is basically that , well , non-zero-sum games have always been part of life .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s probably going to get a lot worse -- this capacity -- because of trends in information technology , in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology .
doing the best i can , ok .
&quot; yahweh is our savior &quot; means &quot; he has saved the nation of israel , &quot; which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
we have civil wars only in six countries , which means that the media are covering only six countries .
so , where should we be putting the money ?
none of those countries , including africa &apos;s most successful nation , botswana , has ever met its quota .
in the process , we , the african people , have been sidelined from the policy-making , policy-orientation , and policy- implementation process in our countries .
public administration , which is largely patronage , takes 690 billion .
we &apos;d like to interview you about that . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now , 14 of the disorders are treatable , two of them actually curable .
so in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
and i believe there are three different -- and i call them different because different interventions build them , it &apos;s possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives .
but it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like debbie reynolds .
and what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set .
i thought , when i first became a therapist 30 years ago , that if i was good enough to make someone not depressed , not anxious , not angry , that i &apos;d make them happy .
a polar bear swimming in the arctic , by paul nicklen .
but this flashbulb memory , as it &apos;s called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it .
nick -- the camera , again , an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this .
sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way .
we also want to look for solutions .
and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out .
thank you .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
emily : image metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
but finally , i got myself involved .
it has also some beautiful primates .
but i was from the west , working in the east .
everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral , killing animals , the logging timbers and so on .
that is coltan extraction , gold mining .
one day , we went to meet the chief commander .
the elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks .
i don &apos;t think that someone may blame google , because it &apos;s doing the right things , even if people like al-qaeda are using google to connect between them .
corneille ewango : a hero of the congo forest
we &apos;ve drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies .
you don &apos;t have to take it out of your budget .
i should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experiments .
democracy does not require perfect equality , but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life .
takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900 , when the line switches to red .
and we got that gift back in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s when women entered the labor force .
electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
and an amazing fact for techno-optimists is that in the first half of the 20th century , the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the 19th century .
that was an essay i wrote when i was 11 years old and i got a b + .
i have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure .
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life .
and it &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say , because they &apos;re not supposed to kill anything .
and you are noticing it more often .
and i needed to find something historically that would match that .
and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ?
and they have to be in all possibilities , including those i never considered before .
but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
now there are magazines about water .
people are paying full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
smooth out the edges ; go for the center ; that &apos;s the big market .
these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be ozzie osborne -- you don &apos;t have to be super-outrageous to do this .
so what you need to do is figure out who does care .
nine months later i found myself spraying messages in tahrir square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my newsfeed .
thank you .
most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward , romanticizing the past .
the first story that i did for national geographic , where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage , was a story i proposed on harp seals .
these are the lions and tigers of the sea .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m somewhat obsessed with sharks -- i wanted to do another , more celebratory , story about sharks , as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation .
after i left bimini , i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort .
they also get entangled in fishing gear .
but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population , low and behold , kelp forests emerged in shallow water .
she &apos;s now living in the jungle of sungai wain , and this is matahari , her second son , which , by the way , is also the son of the second orangutan i rescued , dodoy .
this was like a biological desert .
and then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out .
so how to break that cycle ?
you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen , and without those microorganisms , you won &apos;t have any performance at all .
air humidity is up 10 percent .
so you can actually change the climate .
in north sulawesi it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there , so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .
the spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip .
let me show you one more .
reuben margolin is a kinetic sculptor , crafting beautiful pieces that move in the pattern of raindrops falling and waves combining . take nine minutes and be mesmerized by his meditative art -- inspired in equal parts by math and nature .
and every city has its own design .
and 23 years after , they called us to develop -- we &apos;re developing this idea .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the polish park , the japanese square , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
people always say consciousness is very hard to define .
you cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness .
it &apos;s really a digital computer program running in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn &apos;t imagine doing anything else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers do not wear wristwatches .
maybe they go later , not right away .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard i blew into it .
but we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model , where each school can be flourishing tomorrow .
so erez and i wanted to know more about that .
the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace .
and she got it , she said , &quot; okay , i see it &apos;s serious .
she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon .
i got up , made the cup of tea , sat down with it , did it all and i &apos;m here -- still partly paralyzed , but i &apos;m here .
so peace direct gets behind them to do that .
he wrote a book called &quot; from dictatorship to democracy &quot; with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance .
it isn &apos;t some cultic thing .
in fact , chris was worried and said , &quot; look , don &apos;t show them that slide , because they &apos;re just going to think you &apos;re another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn &apos;t do much .
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution i offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
so i ask , &quot; what would move t , technology , from the numerator -- call it t1 -- where it increases impact , to the denominator -- call it t2 -- where it reduces impact ?
and it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
we literally gained market share .
but about five days later back in atlanta , i received an email from glenn thomas , one of my people in the california meeting .
you know , frankly it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology .
and indeed , do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , whenever they call us together , invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity .
the three ahn sisters breathe new life into the piano trio with their passionate musicmaking . at tedwomen , they start with the bright and poppy &quot; skylife , &quot; by david balakrishnan , then play a gorgeous , slinky version of &quot; oblivion , &quot; by astor piazzolla .
manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild is named after my neighborhood .
he &apos;s making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people .
and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the culinary institute of america , which in their mind is kind of the harvard of cooking schools , and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city .
what we &apos;ve discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie &apos;s music , and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .
these were children who the whole world had given up on , who were flunking out of public school , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked out pretty good up to this day .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to record the concert and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and if you ever choose to sell it , you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school . &quot;
and that is a room that was built for a woman named nancy wilson , who recorded that album at our school last christmas .
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i &apos;ll tell you where i made my big mistake .
he came up to me afterwards , he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s assembled a group of people .
bill strickland tells a quiet and astonishing tale of redemption through arts , music , and unlikely partnerships .
and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output .
but there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy .
but when the bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re all participating in making these molecules , the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number .
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
so this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now , and that &apos;s because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria .
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .
it &apos;s a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
but when we think about justice , aristotle says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing .
what would be your reason ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he put it .
so with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , aristotle has a point .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic debate
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
and , i say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
so then , what do we do about that ?
i &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
i say that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that this threshold exists , because we don &apos;t get age-related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age , even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born .
so , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
none of your media got it right .
we care how we make our profit .
they marched into the center of reykjavik , and they put women &apos;s issues onto the agenda .
but i can &apos;t give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that i &apos;ve learned from the economists , the epidemiologists and the environmentalists .
the health argument is a scary one , and you &apos;ve probably heard part of this argument before .
fourteen americans die each day from asthma , three times what it was in the &apos; 90s , and it &apos;s almost all coming from car exhaust .
he apparently had a sense of humor .
politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a &quot; lifestyle choice . &quot;
the second reason is that we killed these things .
so we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
but immediately , the government said , that &apos;s it , let &apos;s get rid of them , and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw .
it is , shortly , going to think it &apos;s got the ugliest tasmanian devil baby in the world , so maybe it &apos;ll need some help to keep it going .
and the key question for me was to ask peter , has it changed ? and he said no .
what we want to look at is &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s this : a healthy , smiling , beautiful african .
but most of all that they are productively engaged in life , and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen .
how do we combine all this ?
we were on the biafran side .
i had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back , find a way to a window .
you know , we have to use it well .
and many times i don &apos;t see africans working with them .
so our problem right now is , how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way ?
you are undisciplined . &quot;
we have ibukun awosika in nigeria , with the chair company .
and so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product , i took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process .
and it &apos;s been used since the &apos; 90s to study really complex processes .
i &apos;m going to try to condense this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control room here , playing back and forth .
so how do you study rap scientifically ?
you &apos;ve got major cerebellar activity , which is involved in motor coordination .
i mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling .
now this is quite time consuming and isn &apos;t the most comfortable process .
but maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .
they go bad very quickly if you don &apos;t , and if you don &apos;t have stable power grid , this doesn &apos;t happen , so kids die .
another comment of esther &apos;s was that we react when there &apos;s a tragedy like haiti , but that tragedy is ongoing .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria parasite and it &apos;s a very interesting crystalline substance .
we have every road , every village , every , almost , square inch of madagascar .
your blu-ray player has a very cheap blue laser .
audience : yeah !
an interesting thing is , we kill them all the time ; we &apos;ve never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair .
this is the restaurant , acorn house .
if you can see this orange tree , it &apos;s actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and sewn up .
so , water is a very important aspect .
i &apos;ve got metal and earth to come .
the idea is embryonic .
they &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal .
as soon as it touches the water , you should hear a sort of sound of running air .
and as soon as we had these two sequences we thought , if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species , could there be even a smaller genome ?
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .
so accuracy is essential .
and the last one is a richard feynman quote : &quot; what i cannot build , i cannot understand . &quot;
but in fact , here in the northwest , we &apos;re living very close to the real koranic idea of paradise , defined 36 times as &quot; gardens watered by running streams . &quot;
and yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing .
and that number 72 never appears .
this is the nest of the mature colony , and there &apos;s the nest entrance .
so this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer .
the patrollers -- that &apos;s supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active .
and curiously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing .
and the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there .
but the foragers somehow decide not to come out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that show that that &apos;s because the longer an ant stays outside , the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change , and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks .
they cover the earth , except for antarctica .
so here you are , that the cost of all this to the world is 89 million barrels of oil , and the cost annually is three trillion dollars .
and we &apos;re doing it with four percent of the population .
that has nothing to do with it .
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .
and at the time i went into the wind business , natural gas was nine dollars .
why doesn &apos;t that prospect concern you ?
but that only blew out 500 million .
never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else .
tbp : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
you had dotcom fever . and you had gold fever .
ourbeginning.com. life &apos;s an event . announce it to the world .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
this came in , like , six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clogging up a light socket .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
so , i &apos;m going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .
basically it &apos;s just like , if you &apos;re my enemy , if you &apos;re my rival -- if you &apos;re not my friend , if you &apos;re not in my family -- i &apos;m much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you .
either way , your fortunes add up to zero . that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
any form of interdependence , or non-zero-sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people .
and if you tell them , &quot; well , they think america disrespects them and even wants to dominate them , and they hate america .
most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
a child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
so , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
openness isn &apos;t the end .
now , the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell , and it would make you a cancer victim .
what does that mean ?
we found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it , we put the cells in it , and lo and behold , in about four days , they got reorganized and on the right , is what we can make in culture .
and of course , we now ask , where do we go now ?
so i &apos;d like to finish with a poem .
we have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism , a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they &apos;ve pulled it from the shelves ; a new york times exposé on fake book reviews .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they &apos;re all new types of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise .
they had four good friends of a person judge their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lies that before were said and then gone .
they said how big the bathroom was , or they said , you know , here &apos;s how far shopping is from the hotel .
right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
and also you want something that frees your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just secluding away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it wasn &apos;t really -- there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pressing .
i read &quot; peter and the wolf &quot; with this beautiful band from juilliard .
and anybody who would turn around i would , sort of , make a beeline for .
and at least , you know , in my case , because if i just do one thing all the time , i don &apos;t know , i get very , very bored . i bore very easily .
i think of myself as a ... i don &apos;t know what i think of myself as .
do you get nervous , ashleigh ?
im : are you freaking out ? you look so cute .
and again , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , i just think it &apos;s not boring , right ?
if you &apos;ve ever overbeaten your whipped cream , it &apos;s actually buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- where people could be from multi-racial , multi-ethnic backgrounds , but all be equal as citizens in a state .
eventually i was detected , of course , in egypt .
this nigerian student studied in london , trained in yemen , boarded a flight in amsterdam to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground .
anecdotally , we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor , well bin laden is from one of the richest families in saudi arabia .
what happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal , and that was to remove the leader .
these tools don &apos;t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them .
and because of the social connections , chinese students coming elsewhere , and going to school , or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in china -- there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news .
and finally the chinese cracked down .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but having considered it all , i &apos;m still going to vote the way i &apos;m going to vote .
it was on my fourth trip to everest that a comet passed over the mountain . hyakutake .
this is a view looking up the icefall , the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp .
and this is at camp four .
and there were climbers on that summit ridge .
we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers , another climber , had collapsed in the snow and was dead .
it &apos;s so awkward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the injections right through their clothes .
this climber was snow blind .
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it .
and this is how he &apos;s going to turn thought back into action .
these are serphas lighting juniper branches .
and the fourth thing , which i believe is most important , is &quot; the ideas that we need to anticipate . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneurship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are contributing hugely to the society .
it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .
the third thing is again cities .
the second one is the labor policies that we have , which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies , that 93 percent of indian labor is in the unorganized sector .
therefore when you are a young country , again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don &apos;t create entitlement problems as you grow old .
and you must have a clear strategy which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decided to have the elections once again .
and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : &quot; the government does not know better . &quot;
and basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
forty-three .
now , each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison .
so david cameron &apos;s put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea .
toby eccles : invest in social change
i &apos;m working already . &quot;
why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ?
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; greetings , jack . salutations , jack . &quot;
if you guys haven &apos;t figured it out already , my name &apos;s tom thum , and i &apos;m a beatboxer , which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice , and the only thing was my voice .
and last but not least , the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice .
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets .
don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do this , because anyone can .
on the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer .
and i will give you several examples .
you see the transducer , the light blue .
and his wife said , &quot; this is the happiest moment of my life . &quot;
many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
he can stop the surgery at any moment .
canal street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .
and so , they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible .
and their jokes , much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer , really only work within that aesthetic .
it takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time , and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive .
these are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law .
and i really want to thank veronica jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation .
one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord , only to find that the archeologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found .
now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .
and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you &apos;ll remember it &apos;s actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches .
this is the clonal creosote bush , which is around 12,000 years old .
it &apos;s my hope that , by going to find these organisms , that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future .
let &apos;s set it to something else .
twenty years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they &apos;re also building their own mobile phone networks , like this one , which has been deployed in all 31 states of mexico by the narcos .
what did they do with this ?
what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have ?
recently , the fbi arrested an al qaeda affiliate in the united states , who was planning on using these remote-controlled drone aircraft to fly c4 explosives into government buildings in the united states .
as we &apos;ve seen here , we &apos;re transforming ourselves into cyborgs .
it already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it , but it &apos;s hard to get .
they &apos;re killing so many people they can &apos;t even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of ciudad juarez .
but on the other hand , i hear people talking about fear , a sense of risk-aversion .
and tragically , in 1999 , when she was in colombia working with the u &apos;wa people , focused on preserving their culture and language , she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the farc .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t see profit as a blunt instrument .
but the whole community , all the different sects , including shi &apos;a and sunni , would sit together and pray . &quot;
because at the height of the season , at the height of its powers , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , it nourishes the world , it reaches to the heavens . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
but here the problem is , one company is making napkin out of cotton . it is working well .
arunachalam muruganantham : the thing i saw in my wife &apos;s hand , &quot; why are you using that nasty cloth ? &quot;
now 110 countries are accessing it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i &apos;ve been back there ever since , for the last seven years .
and i then went and did a huge amount of training , swimming in icy water , backwards and forwards .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
and my close friend david , he saw the way i was thinking , and he came up to me and he said , &quot; lewis , i &apos;ve known you since you were 18 years old .
and to think that in 30 , 40 years they could become extinct .
britain , america , japan , south africa , the congo .
this is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today .
now that might be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace it all with conventional renewables -- but i think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that .
very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year .
and the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview .
but i wanted interviews that were different .
in fact , the first person i interviewed was george abbott , who was 97 , and abbott was filled with the life force -- i guess that &apos;s the way i think about it -- filled with it .
we know the great lines , we know the great moments , we know what we &apos;re not going to share , and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t this arm-wrestle , but it was a little surprising for the person involved .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . &quot; he said , &quot; i understand that . &quot;
half of her body was stricken , the other half not .
so this is a newborn intensive care unit in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to make beautiful stuff .
there &apos;s one way to treat jaundice , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an exchange transfusion .
it &apos;s not the painting we would have painted , it &apos;s the painting that we actually painted .
another example : again , silly mom .
thank you .
no , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank accounts , on the bank accounts of liechtenstein , of the president &apos;s ministers , the high officials in the para-statal sectors .
they even applaud it .
most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on .
if you think about going into a restaurant , when you look at the menu , are you expected to order every single thing on the menu ?
and it was the first time i &apos;d ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him .
well , he compartmentalizes his life .
he &apos;s an 18th-century french painter best known for his still lifes , but he did occasionally paint people .
so unfortunately , this orphan spends most of his time in storage , along with quite a number of other orphans , some of them some beautiful paintings .
i first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor .
&quot; congratulations on your upcoming nuptials , james .
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa .
i would like to show you six minutes .
lancelot imasen : but our films , they are stories that our people can relate to themselves .
for a young man to really make it out here , you got to think of some negative things and all that , or some kind of vices .
franco sacchi : so many things to say , so little time .
and i think this is really the theme of this session .
franco , you described this as the world &apos;s third largest film industry .
it &apos;s a cd basically . it &apos;s a compact disc .
but here comes the art critic . oh , that was fantastic .
i think this was truly fantastic .
you know , video games can be truly deep even when they &apos;re completely mindless .
so we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior .
along the way , i &apos;ve had to burn a few chairs . you know ?
and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place .
and i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and morandi-like things that i used to do .
and it &apos;s one of the nicest pieces i &apos;ve ever made , i think .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife , which i get credit for participating in .
and one day i had a -- oh , well , the other way .
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
the reality , with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad .
it &apos;s never been finished .
the dome was a request from the client .
and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it &apos;s 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it .
they call it the plan coupe .
there it is .
and from the building in the back , you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills .
our client doesn &apos;t want balconies , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape .
in barcelona i was asked to do a fish , and we &apos;re working on that , at the foot of a ritz-carlton tower being done by skidmore , owings and merrill .
can &apos;t we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ?
and one of the things that they found was they didn &apos;t burn .
and these are the briquettes that we made .
and he &apos;s looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this were india , in this room , only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward .
there &apos;s a definite difference .
after surgery , everything normalizes .
well that &apos;s not surprising , but we also asked them to judge them on honesty , intelligence , friendliness , violence .
he got married . he had a son called jeremiah .
is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a western phenomenon ?
i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we &apos;re at and where we &apos;re going .
we can replace the underlying skeletal structure , but we &apos;re still not good at replacing the facial skin .
my thing with school lunch is , it &apos;s a social justice issue .
and then we talk about organic food .
i mean , people toss around sustainability , but we have to figure out what sustainability is .
you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more .
and that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids .
so this is a typical menu .
you know , the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important , we have to teach kids about in school .
we need to educate the staff .
that 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that &apos;s what the government allocates for lunch .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day .
when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; their eyes glaze over .
i want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness .
don &apos;t take the thrill of it away . i &apos;d rather be mystified .
it &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth .
how do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
can you get it ? how many of you can &apos;t get it ? that &apos;ll help .
we &apos;re going to start easy . some examples .
jeff hawkins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
and the urban planner in london goes , &quot; what do you mean , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s — i mean , no one is in charge . &quot;
now , congestion charges were introduced in stockholm on january 3 , 2006 , and the first picture here is a picture of stockholm , one of the typical streets , january 2 .
well , so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ?
then i have been walking east for 20 years -- from eastern europe to central asia -- through the caucasus mountains , middle east , north africa , russia .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?
the world was changing .
i was at the office ; my desk was clean ; i had the blue partition carpet on the walls .
and there were actually two of these .
it was really something .
how amazing is that ?
now i want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized it reminded me of google earth , where you can fly to any address .
we are , you are , the most underused resource in health care .
so seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology .
so , magnificent creature , isn &apos;t it ?
they do not perceive their environment using sound , and these are the flying foxes .
and for one year in the u.s. alone , it &apos;s estimated that it &apos;s going to cost 22 billion u.s. dollars , if we remove bats . so indeed , bats then do bring us wealth .
so why should we be interested in aging at all ?
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , i want you to smile . thank you .
europe had to be dragged into economic development .
the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
so , what goes wrong ? why is there this &quot; resource curse , &quot; as it &apos;s called ?
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , &quot; why not try an auction ? it &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
around the world right now , one billion people are trapped in poor or failing countries . how can we help them ? economist paul collier lays out a bold , compassionate plan for closing the gap between rich and poor .
there are no little tanks where we &apos;re making surgeons .
so here &apos;s allan teaching an english-speaking surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
so here &apos;s what we think we want to do : imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously .
fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
fourteen years ago , i first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
there they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .
when peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter &apos;s mind taking place .
when you do , what do you want to control ?
and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
now , let me be clear about what i &apos;m not saying . i &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
on the left you have edward witten .
we live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
but again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is the natural enemy , the biologically controlled agent , or the good bug , that we are talking about ?
here we are talking a parasite -- not a two-legged parasite , this is a parasitic wasp , again , two millimeters long , slender , a very quick and sharp flier .
and if we spread those minute pirate bugs , the good ones , for example , in a sweet pepper plot , they go to the flowers .
for example , in israel , where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 dunams in israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection , 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced .
and thirdly , also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry .
automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties .
the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . i do a lot of that .
urban absurdism -- that &apos;s what the new yorker really calls for .
her former name was fay wray , and so that was -- i didn &apos;t have the wit to say , &quot; take the painting . &quot;
or again , the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades , maybe within a decade , of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
they &apos;re at the start of food chains .
in fact , why would we put these balls in the soup , there &apos;s meat in there anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
we can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests , but there &apos;s a limitation very soon .
and some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
allison hunt : my three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
so he said , &quot; allison , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even when a canadian cheats the system , they do it in a way that benefits society .
and in this book , little lewis would know the big idea .
this is a rule device . and on the back are some other devices , measuring tools and scales , to be able to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , that &apos;s how the device is used .
there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable .
so , the first robot to talk about is called strider .
this is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall , it &apos;s 1.8 meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things .
for example , in this case , even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity .
welcome to romela , the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .
but the cool part is the user interface .
let &apos;s see how it does . this was our very first trial , and ... spectators : goal !
so , what is the secret of our success ?
but just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
so , education is very important .
it &apos;s downtowns becoming ghost towns .
there &apos;s basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor &apos;s degree or higher .
there is a total vacuum of creative capital in bertie county .
so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins .
and in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .
and going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that &apos;s a homework assignment .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
and i want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery .
it has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry season .
let &apos;s look at some results .
what we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , i believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels .
so when i heard these two things , it troubled me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons .
it has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center , which was made possible in part by a gift from the ronald mcdonald charity .
after treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .
the answer lies in motion and that &apos;s what i want to show you in the next clip .
i had to have long conversations with my wife .
so we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results to report soon .
and i heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners , and i figured , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t know about this , but before i judge it , let me go see what it &apos;s all about . &quot;
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was rolling around , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then aimee makes it to the 1996 paralympics , and she &apos;s all excited . her family &apos;s coming down -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot;
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designer of them will be at tedmed 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design of them .
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
but identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math .
or about 75,000 jobs .
and another thing about math : math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math education , we &apos;re spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand .
people say , &quot; is such and such true ? &quot;
but automation in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .
all backwards .
but i think we can do both at the same time here .
and one of the reasons it &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important to get computers in exams .
it was the winter of 2009 , and i had been blind for about a year .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery .
similarly , just through the grip of the cane , you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below , and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you &apos;re headed .
but once i lost my sight and was walking along broadway , i was blessed every block of the way .
if you design a city with the blind in mind , there &apos;ll be jobs , lots of jobs .
to give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , &quot; i think you &apos;re fat . &quot;
and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of -- the ten commandments , love your neighbor , be fruitful and multiply .
you donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
so , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when i came over here , the car didn &apos;t flip over , and i didn &apos;t trip coming up the stairs .
so , this was very inspiring to me .
so if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .
so we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
the academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous , so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser .
but alex was preparing a little , sort of obscure , indie , arthouse film called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven spielberg , and invited us to come out from mit and design the interfaces that would appear in that film .
and we &apos;ll perform this boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass .
let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll go ahead and explode it .
we &apos;re , as human beings , the creatures that create , and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image .
john , thank you for making science-fiction real .
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
but here &apos;s the thing : the stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act .
but the group of daycare centers represented by the black line , they said , &quot; we are changing this bargain as of right now .
it &apos;s value created by the participants for each other .
and like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket .
india didn &apos;t want to play the t20 world cup .
the other was indian cricket .
this was the new india , wasn &apos;t it ? this was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
we &apos;d all seen matches in kolkata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : shah rukh , with the bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up for kolkata -- not for india , but for kolkata .
could you have imagined that day would come ?
hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs on leashes .
why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
on the other hand , if you &apos;re visiting an underdeveloped country , and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it &apos;s exorbitant for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
let me just give you an example .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . people don &apos;t think that way .
well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more on this . so , you &apos;re saying that our response to terror is , i mean , it &apos;s a form of mental bug ?
there are no guns going off .
and as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people .
&apos;theme and variations &apos; is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity , because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind .
and this was the text -- &quot; in words as fashion the same rule will hold / alike fantastic if too new or old / be not the first by whom the new are tried / nor yet the last to lay the old aside . &quot;
and one day i woke up and i said , &quot; well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
one is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that i am confident about what i &apos;m doing .
my intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster , in case you don &apos;t get it .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor .
when the room smelled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men .
i feel like i &apos;m coming home to talk about what i &apos;ve been away doing for 20 years .
marcus : it feeds my mind and my soul .
w1 : they suck .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means .
without food -- i was sick .
we don &apos;t need no more trouble get that idiot out !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these children -- it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage , and africa has to live with that .
and throughout the book , there &apos;s over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations .
what is the business here ?
and it didn &apos;t seem , at least , that your sell outs , whatever they were , were very big .
so , i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s probably a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
when i came out of college , i started to try to do things contextually in southern california , and you got into the logic of spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that .
rsw : what &apos;s his schedule on that ?
the mit project -- they were interviewing me for mit and they sent their facilities people to bilbao .
that &apos;s what reminded me of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; now what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
walk around for four months with three wishes , and all the ideas will start to percolate up .
and i think one of the things i also wanted to say in my thanks , which i kind of missed , was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in .
but in the meantime , these things are scaling up .
and this is like 10 weeks later , demolished by hand .
you &apos;re seeing the tuxedos , the bouquets .
the kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something , and these are called the villas .
it &apos;s an incredibly massive operation , i think 15,000 workers , five cupolas , and the sixth one &apos;s coming in here .
this floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor .
fifty percent of the world &apos;s computers end up in china to be recycled .
what was unusual , according to stephen , is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image .
and wish three is : imax film . so i was told i should do one for myself , and i &apos;ve always wanted to actually get involved with doing something .
and it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don &apos;t work for plastics .
the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
now i &apos;m seeing lots of smirks out there .
and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way , over and over again .
maybe we should look at monkey &apos;s economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do .
here &apos;s mayday . she &apos;s going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food .
she &apos;s waiting for the market to open a little impatiently .
so imagine that right now i handed each and every one of you a thousand u.s. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills .
you can either take a risky loss -- so i &apos;ll flip a coin . if it comes up heads , you &apos;re going to actually lose a lot .
if we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market , would they do the same thing as people ?
they guy on the left is a safe loss .
you know , maybe it &apos;s not just humans at the right side of this chain that &apos;s duncey .
and here &apos;s the rub .
but the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on earth .
we need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger , and what we &apos;ve been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood .
that &apos;s the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year .
bomb blast curtains covered my windows .
we might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
sberbank , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely owned by the russian government , has started practicing crowdsourcing , engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations .
we &apos;ve heard talk here at ted about people biohacking and hacking their plants with arduino , and mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos .
and so , i came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
now that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to give a message , and they each read in their own language a central affirmation , and that was some version of the golden rule : &quot; as you would that others would do unto you , do also unto them . &quot;
to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
there are over 180 embassies in washington d.c .
it &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sculptures .
it &apos;s made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit .
the bubble is an anti-monument .
i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five .
one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400 .
as a child so young and tender , words i can &apos;t forget i still remember .
that &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
so my breakfast , my lunch , i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding .
it means that it &apos;s in the low 60 percent .
the way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not yet too late .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t remember anything from when i was five years old .
i mean , santa claus knows if you &apos;re naughty or nice , right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were so ready to start school , honey . you were so ready . &quot;
and they looked at each other and smiled , like that was the right answer . and then they said , &quot; do you believe that we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this planet ? &quot;
maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war , we needed to produce a lot of stuff .
but we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resources we use .
but now for the good news !
it might be latin american .
and i think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in .
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago , a big program called the foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome .
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
as they went from the first building to the second , each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning , clearly in need . the question is : did they stop to help ?
the word is &quot; pizzled &quot; : it &apos;s a combination of puzzled and pissed off .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called stuff : the hidden life of everyday objects .
since then -- it &apos;s been four decades now -- i &apos;ve trained with the best in the field , performed across the globe , taught young and old alike , created , collaborated , choreographed , and wove a rich tapestry of artistry , achievement and awards .
and i found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my very life breath .
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s what it was like then .
he had put it together , combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he &apos;d put it into this software , which i think his son developed , originally , and produces this wonderful presentation .
well , in those documents , there are little squares , little boxes .
well , i &apos;d like to suggest that rather -- yes , make a beautiful website , who am i to say don &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
you ask the linked data -- which they &apos;ve now put together -- 32 hits , each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at .
and that is what linked data is all about .
and combined , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
and if we are , are we ready to iterate , monitor and provide feedback , make sure these promises are really delivering results ?
you just put up , just as one of your numbers there , that 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
how many of you saw a cow crossing in india while you were coming from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that being a human , the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning .
they said , &quot; of course .
can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ? &quot;
so this is a corrugated box and its shadow .
because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
he &apos;s clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here , because if you think about it , what i &apos;ve been talking about today is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists -- that most things are very home-biased .
this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of .
getting a little more technical now .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it .
and it &apos;s very difficult to tune .
it &apos;s competitive . it &apos;s goal-directed .
well , you have pizza when you &apos;re hungry for pizza .
there &apos;s a million different toppings .
so remember , when we &apos;re thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity , baseball , you &apos;re out .
and it goes like this . it &apos;s by a guy called yuan chen : &quot; i cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat .
it was : &quot; what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? &quot;
in over 175 societies , people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system .
they came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal .
and , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think more men are adulterous than women ? &quot;
not at any time on this planet have women been so educated , so interesting , so capable .
she &apos;s 23 . she &apos;s been on them ever since she was 13 .
it got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another .
they &apos;re going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called &quot; this mortal coil . &quot;
but i actually do .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should be asking ourselves , is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity , at least in most people ?
others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
peter attia : is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
but my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people &apos;s lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at ford , but really as an industry .
well i think you probably already have the picture .
but what really inspires me is what &apos;s going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other .
and we must have an infrastructure that &apos;s designed to support this flexible future .
this is a minute 59 .
i think my mother now thinks that i &apos;m some sort of interior decorator .
they &apos;ll ask the nurses to input data .
this stuff is really important . this stuff is really vital . &quot;
so , what came out of this ?
and for us , it &apos;s been great because it &apos;s won loads of design awards .
i got infected when i was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me .
it was about all children . so , we were shameless .
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .
for our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids .
but what i never said , and what i &apos;m really going to make the point is , that really , green is cool .
probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here , as we generously had gifted at lunchtime , the &#91; unclear &#93; , which is a further kind of development -- and again , inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel .
so , if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities , which took 200 years , then that same process is happening in 20 years .
it anticipated change , even though those changes were not known .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
i mean , a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean .
and how do we make more legible in this growing world , especially in some of the places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports .
and i think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness .
as opposed to the first office that i showed you in the beginning of the talk , this is a well-known office , which is the white group .
and behind them , you see that seagram building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design .
and , i mean , that is quite amazing , what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground .
now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
they are not disturbed anymore .
when our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of india , about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable , he missed the point .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home , maybe i saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if i only could be like the honey bee , life would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what has it been used for ? what has it been used for ?
doing what ? breaking stones , digging earth .
that &apos;s the only space she could express her creativity .
they don &apos;t want second-standard , second-quality outputs .
and that is what mansukh bhai prajapati has done .
i had to meet my love .
mr. kharai who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only .
assam , kanak gogoi .
that &apos;s reassuring .
that &apos;s 3.2 billion people .
or skiing . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things .
so we &apos;ve been working really , really hard , but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what &apos;s important , and how to apply the technology .
cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they &apos;re wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the long-range , high-speed problems .
so if we put this box on here in a few years , could we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ?
implicitly or explicitly , there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade , and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner , or , most likely , both .
you will read that los zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press , and this is somewhat true , or mostly true .
and the mexican borders , but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet .
but also it &apos;s part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future . and we have a long lead-time .
after it falls below a critical price , it will tend , if it &apos;s successful , to rise above a critical mass , a penetration .
but they &apos;re getting very , very cheap , and look at the interesting implication of it . as they get cheaper , the premium brands , the sonys and such , are losing market share , and the no-names , the apexes , are gaining them .
if you look here , here &apos;s linux in red , and it &apos;s hit 20 percent .
free is really , you know , the gift of silicon valley to the world .
because of some of technologies we &apos;ve been talking about .
patient capital works between , and tries to take the best of both .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life .
and yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations .
during the hurricane , you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog , updating it frequently . this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .
i like music , and i like banjos , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
and just these little things .
and i &apos;ll probably get choked up , because i tend to when i talk about this .
it was fished sustainably till all of time , except for our generation .
and we &apos;ve got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works .
we &apos;d been studying these fish , but first we had to learn how to husbandry them .
but that &apos;s about half the size of the biggest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they &apos;re coming together . that could be tuna sex -- and there it is .
they can throw out a target -- it &apos;s a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark , a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat .
and then for sort of an encore from these animals , they &apos;re helping us .
we can save the white shark .
and i don &apos;t think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what i did .
but they said , &quot; okay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
now if you go to my bank records , it &apos;ll actually show something from there , so you know that , on may 9th , that i bought $ 14.79 in fuel from safeway vallejo .
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .
when i first started this project , people were looking at me and saying , &quot; why would you want to tell everybody what you &apos;re doing , where you &apos;re at ?
so it &apos;s just become another day .
now let me show you these heat maps of paris to see how insanely fast it &apos;s growing .
now , i &apos;ve looked at thousands of these marketplaces , and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients .
how do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online ?
i was essentially a ghost in the system .
this site receives five and a half thousand questions a day , and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers .
i want to start though with a paradox .
and there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i &apos;ve just shown you , which i shall use over and over again in the data .
we did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we repeated it all on the 50 american states -- asking just the same question : do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ?
extraordinarily damaging , if you &apos;re talking about using the talents of the population .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find rather the same contrast .
the social-evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social-evaluative judgments .
or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .
there &apos;s over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee .
you remember kamal earlier , holding the bamboo staff .
so if you &apos;re wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari , it &apos;s really obvious that you &apos;re wearing a prosthetic limb , and in societies where there &apos;s social stigma around being disabled , people are particularly acute about this .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
in fact , i bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says , &quot; don &apos;t use this juicer to make juice . &quot;
this is one through 20 . next , &quot; they just give you as many o &apos;s as there are pages .
intense fear paralyzes you .
but in fact , if that &apos;s how you always were you &apos;d never get any work done because you &apos;d be working along and say , &quot; oh , i got a new way of doing it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s being safe in the world .
if that amusement park were rusty and falling apart , you &apos;d never go on the ride .
i mean , this is a very small sample ; you should not generalize from it .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization , and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing .
so , i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world .
what you have , actually , is there is one child operating the computer .
natural systems are all self-organizing : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer .
and it &apos;s about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage .
i bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access i had to world events .
but in 2002 , when my tour came to an end , i decided i wasn &apos;t going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london .
i felt just something &apos;s broken .
and i went through it . i went through those mobs .
and i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government .
independent diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world , which is that the world is fragmenting .
we went around 70 u.n. member states -- the kazaks , the ethiopians , the israelis -- you name them , we went to see them -- the secretary general , all of them , and said , &quot; this is all wrong .
you &apos;ve got to look at the outputs , and you got to say to yourself , &quot; what can i do to produce that particular output ? &quot;
trying to think about how a 404 felt , and it would be like if you went to starbucks and there &apos;s the guy behind the counter and you &apos;re over there and there &apos;s no skim milk .
so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
we have the capacity to laugh and cry .
and for the way in which i &apos;m going to present the data , i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling , who you may have just seen .
you get to 1969 , and look what happens .
do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
no , they want judgment .
this happens one day : i &apos;d just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology : viruses and how they attack .
a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
what is the point ? &quot;
the feedback that i get is sometimes misspelled and it &apos;s often written in lolcats , but nonetheless it &apos;s so appreciative , so thankful that i know this is the right way we should be communicating science .
but sometimes it &apos;s as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase .
but here &apos;s the weirdest place of all : war .
durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community .
he said , &quot; if the one tribe included a great number of courageous , sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other . &quot;
there &apos;s a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .
these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere .
politics is partly profane , it &apos;s partly about self-interest , but politics is also about sacredness .
every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . &quot;
and this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
he won the silver medal for ireland in the 1992 olympics , and he trains in this space . he trains other people .
i mean , how nice is that ?
the first book is called , &quot; the end of print , &quot; and it was done along with a film , working with william burroughs .
this is working with marshall mcluhan .
but anyway , i used this for a cover for the nine inch nails dvd , and i &apos;ve also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape , and it &apos;s ready . i think i &apos;m ready . so .
it was a worldwide branding campaign .
and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books .
this is my desktop .
and i remembered seeing this photograph of my father , who was a test pilot , and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot , they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job .
it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in 1829 .
brian farrell &apos;s work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth .
and actually , we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time .
and so it would be sort of approximately up there , coming out of the animal kingdom . and if we were to do that , we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way .
so we &apos;ve all heard about the amish giving up cars .
and each time we make a new opportunity place , we &apos;re allowing a platform to make new ones .
tech enthusiast kevin kelly asks &quot; what does technology want ? &quot; and discovers that its movement toward ubiquity and complexity is much like the evolution of life .
so i was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away , and at that time i could actually focus that close ; now as i look at my fuzzy fingers i realize those days are long gone .
so our first challenge was to find these things , and that was a challenge , indeed .
and it starts getting really nice .
and before the discovery of these vents , all life on earth , the key to life on earth , was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis .
and fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals , fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there &apos;s your pea soup .
and in fact , the way that we can communicate today -- where alaska is instantly knowing what &apos;s going on in china , and the kiwis did this , and then over in england they tried to ...
now my mother was different .
it didn &apos;t work .
new yorker cartoonist liza donnelly shares a portfolio of her wise and funny cartoons about modern life -- and talks about how humor can empower women to change the rules .
is london a great big whale ?
this is what we believe .
one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .
and what you see is a scaling phenomenon .
economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior .
there &apos;s walmart . doesn &apos;t look very sigmoidal .
my first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach american government , loved the political system .
and one opportunity was we got to go and meet paul rusesabagina , which is the gentleman that the movie &quot; hotel rwanda &quot; is based after .
so we did this project , and this is one of the artifacts of the project .
ask them to go to places , to see things for themselves , to actually experience the learning , to play , to inquire .
very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel .
it &apos;s actually quite interesting . if you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care , plotted over your lifetime .
imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb .
steve badylak -- who &apos;s at the university of pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea .
darpa just gave steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
and if you look really carefully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a back-flush .
we have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army , who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from iraq .
so they &apos;re putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area .
but the theme of this session , of course , is invention .
she has me here because she puts me in her show , what she calls her one-woman show .
you know , i couldn &apos;t have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl .
hi . hi .
because , actually , i &apos;m a sophomore at college right now .
it was like , you know , she was there in the class , you know , she was kind of typically french .
but then , i decided , just like governor arnold schwarzenegger , i try anyway .
she said , &quot; no mom . i mean , i don &apos;t like boys . i like girls .
&#91; arabic &#93; and this roughly translates : &quot; please , let me hold your hand .
in 2004 , i started participant productions and we had a really good first year , and no call .
and their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place .
and i asked him what he felt was the best thing i could do , or anyone could do , to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity .
and i wondered who was doing these kinds of films today .
at that point , i thought i knew something about global warming .
and all the people in this room have done so through their business lives , or their philanthropic work , or their other interests .
and the capital -- well , what used to be the capital of nigeria -- lagos , that &apos;s a taxi , and you have police on them .
i want them to think , &quot; well there &apos;s some hope . &quot;
it took us two days just to organize the place , but hey , you know , we worked on it . does he look happy ?
we did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully .
so that &apos;s not new . what we &apos;re doing is applying this technology to it .
and so i committed -- when i left south africa , when i left capetown , i told myself , &quot; this is going to be something that i have to talk about .
aaron motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
the doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
the american political cartoonist mark fiore also had his satire application censored in the united states because some of apple &apos;s staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups .
in protest over this , blogger slim amamou , who had been jailed under ben ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution , he resigned in protest from the cabinet .
this has a chilling effect on people &apos;s ability to use the internet to hold government accountable .
each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world &apos;s people and not the other way around .
like this character . remember these guys ?
and where were they heading ?
and it &apos;s the fastest thing on european waters .
well i can tell you , it &apos;s quite a few of them .
and it &apos;s been terribly successful .
you don &apos;t have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime .
that one is a naked biped . why ?
we &apos;ve got to go back to square one and start again . &quot;
and the irony of it is , that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn &apos;t have to wait for a new paradigm to come up .
so this is a close connection between nakedness and water .
it was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak .
some of them have come over .
because i &apos;m older now than george burns was when he said , &quot; at my age , i don &apos;t even buy green bananas . &quot;
it &apos;s such a large conference .
and that &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
it &apos;s like a microscope to the rest of the world .
i came up with a few games .
again , people from all over the country doing -- the watch is particularly incredible .
ze frank : nerdcore comedy
so what actually works ?
lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent .
and much of what i do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .
so many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves .
the glaciers are actually leaving us .
now i don &apos;t mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal .
we &apos;re approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at world war ii , and the baby boomers haven &apos;t even retired yet , and when they do , this is what will happen .
this is an image of muslims circling the kaaba in mecca .
do you know why they do this ?
and we will never again have a large group of conservative southern democrats and liberal northern republicans making it easy , making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation .
because actually , we do face this situation .
the new york times finally noticed this asteroid with a front-page story last july showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality .
for example , the incarceration rate , the prison population in this country has quadrupled since 1980 .
so , i &apos;m interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture .
so , bottom-up materials actually exist today .
what we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles .
i might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital , but that isn &apos;t how my life turned out .
fortunately , i did not actually enact that grave prognosis .
so the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at yale law school .
once there , someone i &apos;ll just call &apos; the doctor &apos; and his whole team of goons swooped down , lifted me high into the air , and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that i saw stars .
in fact , until very recently , and i &apos;m sure some people still hold it as a view , that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe .
i think you need to be in the hospital .
it &apos;s a national tragedy and scandal that the l.a. county jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the united states .
and even though a hundred teams were there , these cars went nowhere .
you could regain this time .
well , it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like montana .
if you include all the drain , it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer .
okay ?
what makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses , who has flaws , who is maybe not immediately likable , but eventually relatable .
he looks like this .
because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in google , my company .
it was two persons saying , &quot; let &apos;s do this , &quot; and the company said , &quot; yes . &quot;
it creates a vibrant , energetic community where people admire and respect each other .
so &quot; search inside yourself &quot; -- how does it work ?
i found this to be true , both on the individual level and at a corporate level .
and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
and i can basically look everywhere i want , see every movie i &apos;ve always wanted to see .
i &apos;m italian . in italy , design is normal .
and that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the lawrence livermore lab in california ; at that time , they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market .
and then when 9 / 11 happened , i had a shock and i canceled the exhibition until , slowly but surely , it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety .
this is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically .
paola antonelli , design curator at new york &apos;s museum of modern art , wants to spread her appreciation of design -- in all shapes and forms -- around the world .
now , when i was born , they realized they had a pretty smart kid , and they didn &apos;t want me to go to the neighborhood school , which was free .
they called me two weeks later , they &apos;re like , oh , yeah , you can come now . and i told them to stuff it .
at least he &apos;ll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation .
we had some of them this morning .
and for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be , should i move back , should i stay ?
you &apos;re not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart .
i was helping her pay her tuition .
and he said , &quot; look , you can get into harvard , you &apos;re that good , ok ?
with syria to the north , israel and palestine to the south , and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable .
the marathon grew .
stereotypes have been broken .
so abhishek actually made me wait .
it &apos;s essentially a village health worker , a matron .
my business plan is very simple .
this led to open-heart surgery . this is the actual real email from my doctor right there .
and , on the left , riley .
resources weren &apos;t there to develop them .
the average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years .
that is how you all happen to use and enjoy water .
this slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we &apos;ve been working on over the past two years .
somebody gives you a bet . you will look at a crystal ball and you will see the future . the future will be accurate .
and can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe ?
if you maintain nonviolent discipline , you will exclusively win .
in egypt , you can tell that something is happening there .
there are risks to be taken and there are living people who are winning the struggle .
at what point did i think that was a good idea ? &quot;
and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic , but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic .
to create is to make something that has never existed before .
&quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; i study shame . &quot; &quot; oh . &quot;
so you know what i did ? i made it . &quot;
you never finished that mba . your wife left you .
it &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ? &quot;
we want you to go in .
so within the motor , we have three hall sensors , so we know exactly where the wing is .
i couldn &apos;t thread a needle or see the lice in my hair .
it is ourselves we are healing .
they receive comprehensive eye exams .
the result has been , over the years , the expenditure has increased with volumes .
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ?
it is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
as humans , we are social , we are empathic , and that &apos;s great .
but even though i had this newfound joy and freedom , people &apos;s reaction completely changed towards me .
in fact , i now call the underwater wheelchair &quot; portal , &quot; because it &apos;s literally pushed me through into a new way of being , into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness .
and when it inevitably does , the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case , throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole .
now this is actually a popular plaque , and this is a crowd of overachievers , so i &apos;m betting that some of you have this plaque .
in a way , that is the story of the settling of the americas , the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which europeans escaped .
so this is where the tar sands live , under one of the last magnificent boreal forests .
but , of course , our secular religion is technology .
bf : nice show , daniel , nice show . you are the man !
in order to do six cups , i must have perfect control over three with my right hand .
rw : in all past years i &apos;ve rehearsed with them , the things that have happened to me -- i have no idea what &apos;s going to happen and that &apos;s the truth .
dh : one more , one more .
bf : here we go .
bf : yeah .
i think that &apos;s uncomfortable for everyone .
bf : nice .
dh : we will juggle seven .
he held the post that newton held at cambridge , and that was recently held by stephen hawking .
now , if we look at this , and we stop for a minute , and we think about chips today , we can &apos;t look inside a silicon chip . it &apos;s just so tiny .
now , some people call her the first programmer .
so , where does that bring us today ?
alberta sand oil , a lot of pollution .
according to fao , if we don &apos;t change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050 .
love ? love is nice if you can have it .
thank you for having fed me and raised me , and for making my life of today . thank you .
we &apos;ve managed to adapt , and have conquered the whole planet .
y luc besson is the producer of the movie .
but in fact , if i were to place one base on each pixel of this 1280 by 800 resolution screen , we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
they &apos;re one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools .
now look , as long as we continue to increase the population , we &apos;re going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods , and that &apos;s the only position that i &apos;ll take today .
do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy ?
and like any new technology , it &apos;s really in humanity &apos;s hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind , or not .
instead of entering the bone dozens of times , we enter just once , into the front of the hip or the back of the hip .
and ultimately -- and here &apos;s a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors , who come together for a reunion each year at stanford .
in this setup , schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that , by the laws of quantum mechanics , branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not .
this is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting .
but if we plot them out according to their charges , some beautiful patterns emerge .
so these patterns of charges are not just pretty .
when we look at this new unified pattern , we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing .
this e8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots .
but in science , if something isn &apos;t working , you have to toss it out and try something else .
and that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this e8 pattern could be the rest of the picture .
he was talking about this amazing , three-year-old australopithecine child , selam .
and they swagger and they throw rocks .
perhaps build some schoolrooms .
and everywhere there were these terrible problems .
shoots seem tiny ; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall .
that &apos;s a very important component of roots and shoots , with older kids talking to younger ones .
you &apos;ve heard about it this afternoon . it &apos;s beginning to happen .
i turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations .
it &apos;s plastic pollution .
and so my research group at the media lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way , without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior .
if he picks up a book in the bookstore , he can get an amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book .
we didn &apos;t know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later .
i was married when i was 14 .
and aicha started , and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll feel that it &apos;s from a safe source .
now i spent a lot of time in my garage , over the next weeks and months , and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife .
michael pritchard : okay . we &apos;ve got some runoff from a sewage plant farm .
let &apos;s see chris &apos;s program throughout the rest of the show . okay ?
all we &apos;ve go to do is make it sterile . how do we do that ?
and of course , into the vacuum where the too-old european powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part : the two great world wars .
i &apos;m not talking about setting up some global democratic institution .
in fact , what &apos;s now emerging is the much more normal case of history .
you know , up until now , if the west got its act together , it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world .
we are now interlocked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before .
you understand that in industry ; governments don &apos;t .
so the premise of blue zones : if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity .
i love that word .
these are years that we could get .
it &apos;s a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
fifteen years ago , the average american had three good friends .
my editor at geographic wanted me to find america &apos;s blue zone .
so , if you go to an adventist &apos;s party you don &apos;t see people swilling jim beam or rolling a joint .
what are the things that they all do ?
instead , these people drink a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the american population .
so conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires .
secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers .
so i feel a bit as ted nelson must have when , in the early 1970s , he wrote , &quot; you must understand computers now . &quot;
you &apos;re tasked with navigating it down partially-seen roadways , in and amongst other metal giants , at super-human speeds .
that guy &apos;s been on the road probably for the last half hour .
if one guy has a really great car , they &apos;re not probably in the best position to react in an emergency .
and i met professor hawking , and he said his dream was to travel into space .
we set up a whole er .
they are unique . they are useful -- sometimes , often a long time after the fact .
and the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly , from information that &apos;s brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes .
at first , living in the van was great .
and i don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
because i was a writer .
but we began with a family-planning program , following a very successful maternal child health activity , sets of activities .
wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women , selling things -- here &apos;s the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people , you &apos;ll find contraceptives in thailand .
in thailand , for poor people , diamonds don &apos;t make it -- so the condom is the girl &apos;s best friend .
in all this thing , from seven children to 1.5 children , population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5 .
so they were happy with that .
we found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction , but we have found the weapon of mass protection : the condom .
because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit .
that &apos;s the difference .
and as it turns out , that &apos;s a really hard problem , because you have to build a small , portable robot that &apos;s not only really affordable , but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids .
i &apos;ve always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person ted audience .
you do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for romo .
that made me a celebrity . now people recognize me in macy &apos;s , and my grandchildren think that i &apos;m cool .
i need mavericks , dissidents , adventurers , outsiders and rebels , who ask questions , bend the rules and take risks .
sophia loren was right in front of me -- she &apos;s a foot taller than i am , not counting the poofy hair .
i look around and i see them everywhere .
the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars .
she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees .
abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom .
as you &apos;re thinking , this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market . right ?
they don &apos;t necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22 .
the uninformed player doesn &apos;t know , but they know that the informed player knows .
that is , the informed brain seems to be deciding , &quot; we &apos;re probably not going to make a deal here . &quot;
wrong .
they &apos;re closer to 50-50 . they &apos;re not responding to payoffs as closely , and also if you study their learning in the game , they aren &apos;t as sensitive to previous rewards .
we &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
famously , rome had about a million citizens by the first century a.d .
i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this . anyway , and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes .
in fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
and that is the problem with these utopian ideas , that they are utopian .
cows with a view .
we know we are what we eat .
and of course it &apos;s not just religious people who believe in the golden rule .
i &apos;d like youth to get a sense of the dynamism , the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle .
so i &apos;m going to show you what i believe is the current state of manufacturing , and then compare that to some natural systems .
can we really scale this up ? can we really embed robotics into every part ?
so it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system .
he was later , it &apos;s said , the basis of the indiana jones character .
and just to give you a sense of how this works , imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you .
go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore .
well , at enormous expense , ted has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space -- the view from intergalactic space .
that physical objects , as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time .
probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back .
if medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only , then it would achieve very little of either .
the president wanted to change this rule .
haiti is also dark , compared to its neighbor here , the dominican republic , which has about the same number of residents .
so they created four special economic zones around hong kong : zones where chinese could come and work , and cities grew up very rapidly there ; also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things .
you start from uninhabited territory .
well , africa . i &apos;ve talked with leaders in africa .
but , you could set us to work thinking about questions like , suppose it isn &apos;t just canada that does the deal with raul castro .
so in the last decade , a large number of genomes have been added : most human pathogens , a couple of plants , several insects and several mammals , including the human genome .
and these vary tremendously from region to region .
and we got these overlapping circles . and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms .
this is derived from an organism , deinococcus radiodurans , that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed .
i think future engineered species could be the source of food , hopefully a source of energy , environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry .
they can have one marshmallow now . but if they wait until the experimenter comes back , they can have two .
cost-benefit analysis .
i &apos;m sure that resonates with some of the tedsters .
so , what kind of stories might make a difference for the future ?
in fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .
it &apos;s dark . high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth .
it was a tremendously emotional event , and it &apos;s something that i will personally never forget , and you shouldn &apos;t either .
where were they ? it got even more puzzling when we found dunes .
because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once , but twice , independently , in our solar system , then that means , by inference , it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history .
about seven years ago , they faced extinction , because israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village .
israeli a nonviolent protest is not going to stop the &#91; unclear &#93; .
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .
at google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points .
it &apos;s named after latin for &quot; seahorse , &quot; which it resembles .
so this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus .
he &apos;s probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .
why is it that martin luther king led the civil rights movement ?
why does your organization exist ?
what it proves to us is that people don &apos;t buy what you do ; people buy why you do it .
our newest brain , our homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the &quot; what &quot; level .
and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things : under-capitalized , the wrong people , bad market conditions .
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
in fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe .
it pauses live tv , skips commercials , memorizes your viewing habits , etc . , etc . &quot;
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
so i called barry , and with his blessing , in october 1995 walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at boston medical center .
and they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket , which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic .
so that &apos;s where health leads began .
how did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting ?
and this isn &apos;t just a sort of short-term workforce to connect patients to basic resources , it &apos;s a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
it &apos;s got concertina wire along the sides of it .
it was built in the jungles of south america .
you would be correct .
&quot; mom , i see the world . &quot;
thank you .
if you are a child under the age of 10 who haven &apos;t been ruined yet , you will look at this image and see dolphins . now , some of you adults here are saying , &quot; what dolphins ? what dolphins ? &quot;
and let me repeat what you saw last year .
and if i go back in time , i &apos;ve added some historical statistics -- here we go , here we go , here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago .
the philippines of today has almost the same economy as the united states during the first world war .
they really caught up .
singapore is the best one .
everyone lives on this street here .
when you &apos;re in poverty , everything is about survival .
because we don &apos;t consider where they came from .
economic growth to me , as a public-health professor , is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival .
even african countries can achieve this .
this is gobbledygook for if the united states fights somebody we &apos;re going to be huge .
there is no battle space the u.s. military cannot access .
in a perfect world we &apos;d have 50,000 there .
like the 250,000 dead so far in sudan .
france says , &quot; no , but i do like to criticize you after the fact . &quot;
would you like kim jong-il , who &apos;s killed about two million people , would you like him gone ?
it &apos;s like the guy who goes to the doctor and says , &quot; doctor , it hurts when i do this . &quot;
our long-term rationale becomes , we &apos;re involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets .
that sys admin force is the force that never comes home , does most of your work .
i say , &quot; great , i &apos;m going to take the sys admin budget out of your hide . &quot;
air force , strategic airlift goes both ways .
thomas barnett draws a new map for peace
i don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
here &apos;s mount pinatubo in the early &apos; 90s . that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud .
that report that landed on president johnson &apos;s desk when i was two years old -- 1965 .
but let &apos;s say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it &apos;s unevenly heated .
now , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
because under this scenario , we walk further and further away from the current climate .
not just at how you would do it better , but also what all the risks and downsides of it are .
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes .
positively amazing . here &apos;s two males fighting .
and so i just came , two days ago , from the himalayas to your kind invitation .
but then , if you look in the literature , east and west , you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness .
it is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment , a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states , and all the joys and sorrows that can come one &apos;s way .
we know , by experience , that we can be what we call &quot; a little paradise , &quot; and yet , be completely unhappy within .
the mirror allows that , but the mirror is not tainted , is not modified , is not altered by those images .
if you do this again and again , the propensity , the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it .
of course , during the training , we do that with objects .
we are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .
and it &apos;s a tremendous problem for us .
it &apos;s a place worth caring about . it &apos;s well defined .
you can see exactly what went on , three o &apos;clock in the morning at the design meeting .
not just flower beds , not just cartoons of the sierra nevada mountains .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot;
we &apos;re going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the bulgarians would be ashamed of !
one final thing -- i &apos;ve been very disturbed about this for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
we &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
this is some life-support equipment closed-cycle .
the ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time , allowing it to do new exploration while it &apos;s still achieving geometric sensor-lock on what it &apos;s gone through already .
you &apos;d pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit .
it says you &apos;re moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
it can be done in seven years with the right backing .
so i suppose you &apos;re not going to be able to kick me off the stage , since you asked the question .
i mean , there are a few launches you &apos;ve done where the brand maybe hasn &apos;t worked quite as well .
rb : no .
i think , with us , we &apos;ve got a video that shows what you &apos;re up to , and virgin galactic up in the air .
did he tell you to jump , or he just said , &quot; i &apos;m out of here ! &quot; and ...
ok , this isn &apos;t exactly hardball . ok .
i mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this dilemma about how you bring them up .
rb : so our key witness argued that it was actually &quot; never mind the priest , here &apos;s the sex pistols . &quot;
and actually , we &apos;ve had about 15,000 people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go .
no , i just want to live life to its full .
