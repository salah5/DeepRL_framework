# A DeepRL Framework for NLP 

This repository provides a deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) framework for NLP tasks. It is deep because it utilizes neural network models to represent the concepts in reinforcement learning, e.g., states are encoded by the RNN structure. Your interest to this project is highly appreciated. Please give a Github star (on top right) if you use the code in anyhow.
